Santificado seja o teu nome.
10Venha o teu Reino;
seja feita a tua vontade,
assim na terra como no céu.
11Dá-nos hoje o nosso
pão de cada dia.
12Perdoa as nossas dívidas,
assim como perdoamos
aos nossos devedores.
13E não nos deixes cair
em tentação,
mas livra-nos do mal,
porque teu é o Reino, o poder e a glória para sempre. Amém.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém

2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente. Amém.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu

A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele nos carrega em seus braços.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:

I found a lover, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass

Apocalipse 7
1	E depois destas coisas vi quatro anjos que estavam sobre os quatro cantos da terra, retendo os quatro ventos da terra, para que nenhum vento soprasse sobre a terra, nem sobre o mar, nem contra árvore alguma.
2	E vi outro anjo subir do lado do sol nascente, e que tinha o selo do Deus vivo; e clamou com grande voz aos quatro anjos, a quem fora dado o poder de danificar a terra e o mar,
3	Dizendo: Não danifiqueis a terra, nem o mar, nem as árvores, até que hajamos assinalado nas suas testas os servos do nosso Deus.
4	E ouvi o número dos assinalados, e eram cento e quarenta e quatro mil assinalados, de todas as tribos dos filhos de Israel.
5	Da tribo de Judá, havia doze mil assinalados; da tribo de Rúben, doze mil assinalados; da tribo de Gade, doze mil assinalados;
6	Da tribo de Aser, doze mil assinalados; da tribo de Naftali, doze mil assinalados; da tribo de Manassés, doze mil assinalados;
7	Da tribo de Simeão, doze mil assinalados; da tribo de Levi, doze mil assinalados; da tribo de Issacar, doze mil assinalados;
8	Da tribo de Zebulom, doze mil assinalados; da tribo de José, doze mil assinalados; da tribo de Benjamim, doze mil assinalados.
9	Depois destas coisas olhei, e eis aqui uma multidão, a qual ninguém podia contar, de todas as nações, e tribos, e povos, e línguas, que estavam diante do trono, e perante o Cordeiro, trajando vestes brancas e com palmas nas suas mãos;
10	E clamavam com grande voz, dizendo: Salvação ao nosso Deus, que está assentado no trono, e ao Cordeiro.
11	E todos os anjos estavam ao redor do trono, e dos anciãos, e dos quatro animais; e prostraram-se diante do trono sobre seus rostos, e adoraram a Deus,
12	Dizendo: Amém. Louvor, e glória, e sabedoria, e ação de graças, e honra, e poder, e força ao nosso Deus, para todo o sempre. Amém.
13	E um dos anciãos me falou, dizendo: Estes que estão vestidos de vestes brancas, quem são, e de onde vieram?
14	E eu disse-lhe: Senhor, tu sabes. E ele disse-me: Estes são os que vieram da grande tribulação, e lavaram as suas vestes e as branquearam no sangue do Cordeiro.
15	Por isso estão diante do trono de Deus, e o servem de dia e de noite no seu templo; e aquele que está assentado sobre o trono os cobrirá com a sua sombra.
16	Nunca mais terão fome, nunca mais terão sede; nem sol nem calma alguma cairá sobre eles.
17	Porque o Cordeiro que está no meio do trono os apascentará, e lhes servirá de guia para as fontes das águas da vida; e Deus limpará de seus olhos toda a lágrima.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.",soberano senhor meu deus meu salvador tu proteges cabe dia combate louvado seja senhor louvado

"Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele nos carrega em seus braços.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente. Amém.Ora, a fé é o firme fundamento das coisas que se esperam, e a prova das coisas que não se veem.
2 Porque por ela os antigos alcançaram testemunho.
3 Pela fé entendemos que os mundos pela palavra de Deus foram criados; de maneira que aquilo que se vê não foi feito do que é aparente.
4 Pela fé Abel ofereceu a Deus maior sacrifício do que Caim, pelo qual alcançou testemunho de que era justo, dando Deus testemunho dos seus dons, e por ela, depois de morto, ainda fala.
5 Pela fé Enoque foi trasladado para não ver a morte, e não foi achado, porque Deus o trasladara; visto como antes da sua trasladação alcançou testemunho de que agradara a Deus.
6 Ora, sem fé é impossível agradar-lhe; porque é necessário que aquele que se aproxima de Deus creia que ele existe, e que é galardoador dos que o buscam.",senhor mas ao teu nome gl ria por amor da tua benignidade da tua verdade por que dir os gentios onde est seu deus mas nosso deus est nos us fez tudo que lhe agradou os dolos deles prata ouro obra das os dos homens boca mas falam olhos mas veem ouvidos mas ouvem narizes mas cheiram os mas apalpam mas andam nem som algum sai da sua garganta eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem assim como todos os que neles confiam israel confia senhor ele seu aux lio seu escudo 10 casa de ar confia senhor ele seu aux lio seu escudo 11 os que temeis ao senhor confiai senhor ele seu aux lio seu escudo 12 senhor se lembrou de ele nos aben oar aben oar casa de israel aben oar casa de ar 13 aben oar os que temem ao senhor tanto pequenos como grandes 14 senhor vos aumentar cada vez mais vossos filhos 15 sois benditos senhor que fez os us terra 16 os us os us senhor mas terra deu aos filhos dos homens 17 os mortos louvam ao senhor nem os que descem ao sil ncio 18 mas bendiremos ao senhor desde agora para sempre louvai ao senhor qual deus far se cumprir devido tempo ele bendito nico soberano rei dos reis senhor dos senhores nico que imortal habita em luz inacess vel quem ningu viu nem pode ver ele sejam honra poder para sempre senhor estabeleceu seu trono nos us como rei domina sobre tudo que existe soberano senhor meu deus meu salvador tu proteges cabe dia combate louvado seja senhor louvado seja deus nosso salvador cada dia ele nos carrega em seus bra os ent falou deus todas estas palavras dizendo eu sou senhor teu deus que te tirei da terra egito da casa da servid ter outros deuses diante de mim far para ti imagem de escultura nem alguma semelhan que em cima nos us nem embaixo na terra nem nas guas debaixo da terra te encurvar elas nem servir porque eu senhor teu deus sou deus zeloso que visito iniquidade dos pais nos filhos terceira quarta gera daqueles que odeiam fa miseric rdia milhares dos que amam aos que guardam os meus mandamentos tomar nome senhor teu deus em porque senhor ter por inocente que tomar seu nome em lembra te dia bado para santificar seis dias trabalhar far toda tua obra 10 mas timo dia bado senhor teu deus far nenhuma obra nem tu nem teu filho nem tua filha nem teu servo nem tua serva nem teu animal nem teu estrangeiro que est dentro das tuas portas 11 porque em seis dias fez senhor os us terra mar tudo que neles ao timo dia descansou portanto aben oou senhor dia bado santificou 12 honra teu pai tua para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que senhor teu deus te 13 matar 14 adulterar 15 furtar 16 dir falso testemunho contra teu pr ximo 17 cobi ar casa teu pr ximo cobi ar mulher teu pr ximo nem seu servo nem sua serva nem seu boi nem seu jumento nem coisa alguma teu pr ximo 18 todo povo viu os trov es os rel mpagos sonido da trombeta monte fumegando povo vendo isso retirou se se de longe 19 disseram mois fala tu conosco ouviremos fale deus conosco para que morramos 20 disse mois ao povo temais deus veio para vos provar para que seu temor esteja diante de fim de que pequeis 21 povo estava em de longe mois por se chegou escurid onde deus estava 22 ent disse senhor mois assim dir aos filhos de israel tendes visto que dos us eu falei convosco 23 fareis outros deuses comigo deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro fareis para 24 um altar de terra far sobre ele sacrificar os teus holocaustos tuas ofertas pac ficas tuas ovelhas tuas vacas em todo lugar onde eu fizer celebrar mem ria meu nome virei ti te aben oarei 25 se fizeres um altar de pedras far de pedras lavradas se sobre ele levantares teu buril profan lo 26 tamb subir ao meu altar por degraus para que tua nudez seja descoberta diante deles porque dele por ele para ele todas coisas gl ria pois ele eternamente ora firme fundamento das coisas que se esperam prova das coisas que se veem porque por ela os antigos alcan aram testemunho pela entendemos que os mundos pela palavra de deus foram criados de maneira que aquilo que se foi feito que aparente pela abel ofereceu deus maior sacrif cio que caim pelo qual alcan ou testemunho de que era justo dando deus testemunho dos seus dons por ela depois de morto ainda fala pela enoque foi trasladado para ver morte foi achado porque deus trasladara visto como antes da sua traslada alcan ou testemunho de que agradara deus ora sem imposs vel agradar lhe porque necess rio que aquele que se aproxima de deus creia que ele existe que galardoador dos que buscam,NEUTRAL,0.07670999,0.86504,0.058249958,0.86504,5435,1070,1,en

"Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente. Amém.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele nos carrega em seus braços.Louvado seja o Senhor; louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador! A cada dia ele nos carrega em seus braços.DEUS PAI VIVO ALTÍSSIMO FIEL O TODO PODEROSO,CRIADOR,PERFEITO,

Salmos 140
1	[Salmo de Davi para o músico-mor] Livra-me, ó SENHOR, do homem mau; guarda-me do homem violento,
2	Que pensa o mal no coração; continuamente se ajuntam para a guerra.
3	Aguçaram as línguas como a serpente; o veneno das víboras está debaixo dos seus lábios. (Selá.)
4	Guarda-me, ó SENHOR, das mãos do ímpio; guarda-me do homem violento; os quais se propuseram transtornar os meus passos.
5	Os soberbos armaram-me laços e cordas; estenderam a rede ao lado do caminho; armaram-me laços corrediços. (Selá.)
6	Eu disse ao SENHOR: Tu és o meu Deus; ouve a voz das minhas súplicas, ó SENHOR.
7	O DEUS o Senhor, fortaleza da minha salvação, tu cobriste a minha cabeça no dia da batalha.
8	Não concedas, ó SENHOR, ao ímpio os seus desejos; não promovas o seu mau propósito, para que não se exalte. (Selá.)
9	Quanto à cabeça dos que me cercam, cubra-os a maldade dos seus lábios.
10	Caiam sobre eles brasas vivas; sejam lançados no fogo, em covas profundas, para que se não tornem a levantar.
11	Não terá firmeza na terra o homem de má língua; o mal perseguirá o homem violento até que seja desterrado.
12	Sei que o SENHOR sustentará a causa do oprimido, e o direito do necessitado.
13	Assim os justos louvarão o teu nome; os retos habitarão na tua presença.",senhor mas ao teu nome gl ria por amor da tua benignidade da tua verdade por que dir os gentios onde est seu deus mas nosso

Santificado seja o teu nome.
10Venha o teu Reino;
seja feita a tua vontade,
assim na terra como no céu.
11Dá-nos hoje o nosso
pão de cada dia.
12Perdoa as nossas dívidas,
assim como perdoamos
aos nossos devedores.
13E não nos deixes cair
em tentação,
mas livra-nos do mal,
porque teu é o Reino, o poder e a glória para sempre. Amém.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente. Amém.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele

10Venha o teu Reino;

11Dá-nos hoje o nosso

12Perdoa as nossas dívidas,
assim como perdoamos
aos nossos devedores.
13E não nos deixes cair
em tentação,
mas livra-nos do mal,
porque teu é o Reino, o poder e a glória para sempre. Amém.1 No princípio criou Deus os céus e a terra.
2 E a terra era sem forma e vazia; e havia trevas sobre a face do abismo; e o Espírito de Deus se movia sobre a face das águas.
3 E disse Deus: Haja luz; e houve luz.
4 E viu Deus que era boa a luz; e fez Deus separação entre a luz e as trevas.
5 E Deus chamou à luz Dia; e às trevas chamou Noite. E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia primeiro.
6 E disse Deus: Haja uma expansão no meio das águas, e haja separação entre águas e águas.
7 E fez Deus a expansão, e fez separação entre as águas que estavam debaixo da expansão e as águas que estavam sobre a expansão; e assim foi.
8 E chamou Deus à expansão Céus, e foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia segundo.
9 E disse Deus: Ajuntem-se as águas debaixo dos céus num lugar; e apareça a porção seca; e assim foi.
10 E chamou Deus à porção seca Terra; e ao ajuntamento das águas chamou Mares; e viu Deus que era bom.
11 E disse Deus: Produza a terra erva verde, erva que dê semente, árvore frutífera que dê fruto segundo a sua espécie, cuja semente está nela sobre a terra; e assim foi.
12 E a terra produziu erva, erva dando semente conforme a sua espécie, e a árvore frutífera, cuja semente está nela conforme a sua espécie; e viu Deus que era bom.
13 E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia terceiro.
14 E disse Deus: Haja luminares na expansão dos céus, para haver separação entre o dia e a noite; e sejam eles para sinais e para tempos determinados e para dias e anos.
15 E sejam para luminares na expansão dos céus, para iluminar a terra; e assim foi.
16 E fez Deus os dois grandes luminares: o luminar maior para governar o dia, e o luminar menor para governar a noite; e fez as estrelas.
17 E Deus os pôs na expansão dos céus para iluminar a terra,
18 E para governar o dia e a noite, e para fazer separação entre a luz e as trevas; e viu Deus que era bom.
19 E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia quarto.
20 E disse Deus: Produzam as águas abundantemente répteis de alma vivente; e voem as aves sobre a face da expansão dos céus.
21 E Deus criou as grandes baleias, e todo o réptil de alma vivente que as águas abundantemente produziram conforme as suas espécies; e toda a ave de asas conforme a sua espécie; e viu Deus que era bom.
22 E Deus os abençoou, dizendo: Frutificai e multiplicai-vos, e enchei as águas nos mares; e as aves se multipliquem na terra.
23 E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia quinto.
24 E disse Deus: Produza a terra alma vivente conforme a sua espécie; gado, e répteis e feras da terra conforme a sua espécie; e assim foi.
25 E fez Deus as feras da terra conforme a sua espécie, e o gado conforme a sua espécie, e todo o réptil da terra conforme a sua espécie; e viu Deus que era bom.
26 E disse Deus: Façamos o homem à nossa imagem, conforme a nossa semelhança; e domine sobre os peixes do mar, e sobre as aves dos céus, e sobre o gado, e sobre toda a terra, e sobre todo o réptil que se move sobre a terra.
27 E criou Deus o homem à sua imagem; à imagem de Deus o criou; homem e mulher os criou.
28 E Deus os abençoou, e Deus lhes disse: Frutificai e multiplicai-vos, e enchei a terra, e sujeitai-a; e dominai sobre os peixes do mar e sobre as aves dos céus, e sobre todo o animal que se move sobre a terra.
29 E disse Deus: Eis que vos tenho dado toda a erva que dê semente, que está sobre a face de toda a terra; e toda a árvore, em que há fruto que dê semente, ser-vos-á para mantimento.
30 E a todo o animal da terra, e a toda a ave dos céus, e a todo o réptil da terra, em que há alma vivente, toda a erva verde será para mantimento; e assim foi.
31 E viu Deus tudo quanto tinha feito, e eis que era muito bom; e foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia sexto.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele

"Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente. Amém.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele nos carrega em seus braços.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.1 Não se turbe o vosso coração; credes em Deus, crede também em mim.
2 Na casa de meu Pai há muitas moradas; se não fosse assim, eu vo-lo teria dito. Vou preparar-vos lugar.
3 E quando eu for, e vos preparar lugar, virei outra vez, e vos levarei para mim mesmo, para que onde eu estiver estejais vós também.
4 Mesmo vós sabeis para onde vou, e conheceis o caminho.
5 Disse-lhe Tomé: Senhor, nós não sabemos para onde vais; e como podemos saber o caminho?
6 Disse-lhe Jesus: Eu sou o caminho, e a verdade e a vida; ninguém vem ao Pai, senão por mim.
7 Se vós me conhecêsseis a mim, também conheceríeis a meu Pai; e já desde agora o conheceis, e o tendes visto.
8 Disse-lhe Filipe: Senhor, mostra-nos o Pai, o que nos basta.
9 Disse-lhe Jesus: Estou há tanto tempo convosco, e não me tendes conhecido, Filipe? Quem me vê a mim vê o Pai; e como dizes tu: Mostra-nos o Pai?
10 Não crês tu que eu estou no Pai, e que o Pai está em mim? As palavras que eu vos digo não as digo de mim mesmo, mas o Pai, que está em mim, é quem faz as obras.
11 Crede-me que estou no Pai, e o Pai em mim; crede-me, ao menos, por causa das mesmas obras.
12 Na verdade, na verdade vos digo que aquele que crê em mim também fará as obras que eu faço, e as fará maiores do que estas, porque eu vou para meu Pai.
13 E tudo quanto pedirdes em meu nome eu o farei, para que o Pai seja glorificado no Filho.
14 Se pedirdes alguma coisa em meu nome, eu o farei.
15 Se me amais, guardai os meus mandamentos.
16 E eu rogarei ao Pai, e ele vos dará outro Consolador, para que fique convosco para sempre;
17 O Espírito de verdade, que o mundo não pode receber, porque não o vê nem o conhece; mas vós o conheceis, porque habita convosco, e estará em vós.
18 Não vos deixarei órfãos; voltarei para vós.
19 Ainda um pouco, e o mundo não me verá mais, mas vós me vereis; porque eu vivo, e vós vivereis.
20 Naquele dia conhecereis que estou em meu Pai, e vós em mim, e eu em vós.
21 Aquele que tem os meus mandamentos e os guarda esse é o que me ama; e aquele que me ama será amado de meu Pai, e eu o amarei, e me manifestarei a ele.
22 Disse-lhe Judas (não o Iscariotes): Senhor, de onde vem que te hás de manifestar a nós, e não ao mundo?
23 Jesus respondeu, e disse-lhe: Se alguém me ama, guardará a minha palavra, e meu Pai o amará, e viremos para ele, e faremos nele morada.
24 Quem não me ama não guarda as minhas palavras; ora, a palavra que ouvistes não é minha, mas do Pai que me enviou.
25 Tenho-vos dito isto, estando convosco.
26 Mas aquele Consolador, o Espírito Santo, que o Pai enviará em meu nome, esse vos ensinará todas as coisas, e vos fará lembrar de tudo quanto vos tenho dito.
27 Deixo-vos a paz, a minha paz vos dou; não vo-la dou como o mundo a dá. Não se turbe o vosso coração, nem se atemorize.
28 Ouvistes que eu vos disse: Vou, e venho para vós. Se me amásseis, certamente exultaríeis porque eu disse: Vou para o Pai; porque meu Pai é maior do que eu.
29 Eu vo-lo disse agora antes que aconteça, para que, quando acontecer, vós acrediteis.
30 Já não falarei muito convosco, porque se aproxima o príncipe deste mundo, e nada tem em mim;
31 Mas é para que o mundo saiba que eu amo o Pai, e que faço como o Pai me mandou. Levantai-vos, vamo-nos daqui.GOD THE  FATHER, LIVING, MOST HIGH, ALMIGHTY, CREATOR, HOLY AND FAITHFUL JUST GOD, MERCIFUL, JUDGE, BENIGN.Ó profundidade das riquezas, tanto da sabedoria, como do conhecimento de Deus!

"Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off of love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her, the more I suffer
I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown
She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me
And I love it, ""Wait
Where you going?"" ""I'm leaving you""
""No you ain't, come back""
We're running right back, here we go again
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful
I feel so ashamed, I snapped, ""Who's that dude?""
I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her
I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you, even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at 'em
You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday
Yesterday is over, it's a different day
Sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Now I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns
Same routine, but your temper's just as bad as mine is
You're the same as me, when it comes to love, you're just as blinded
Baby, please come back, it wasn't you
Baby, it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie

"1 No princípio criou Deus os céus e a terra.
2 E a terra era sem forma e vazia; e havia trevas sobre a face do abismo; e o Espírito de Deus se movia sobre a face das águas.
3 E disse Deus: Haja luz; e houve luz.
4 E viu Deus que era boa a luz; e fez Deus separação entre a luz e as trevas.
5 E Deus chamou à luz Dia; e às trevas chamou Noite. E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia primeiro.
6 E disse Deus: Haja uma expansão no meio das águas, e haja separação entre águas e águas.
7 E fez Deus a expansão, e fez separação entre as águas que estavam debaixo da expansão e as águas que estavam sobre a expansão; e assim foi.
8 E chamou Deus à expansão Céus, e foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia segundo.
9 E disse Deus: Ajuntem-se as águas debaixo dos céus num lugar; e apareça a porção seca; e assim foi.
10 E chamou Deus à porção seca Terra; e ao ajuntamento das águas chamou Mares; e viu Deus que era bom.
11 E disse Deus: Produza a terra erva verde, erva que dê semente, árvore frutífera que dê fruto segundo a sua espécie, cuja semente está nela sobre a terra; e assim foi.
12 E a terra produziu erva, erva dando semente conforme a sua espécie, e a árvore frutífera, cuja semente está nela conforme a sua espécie; e viu Deus que era bom.
13 E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia terceiro.
14 E disse Deus: Haja luminares na expansão dos céus, para haver separação entre o dia e a noite; e sejam eles para sinais e para tempos determinados e para dias e anos.
15 E sejam para luminares na expansão dos céus, para iluminar a terra; e assim foi.
16 E fez Deus os dois grandes luminares: o luminar maior para governar o dia, e o luminar menor para governar a noite; e fez as estrelas.
17 E Deus os pôs na expansão dos céus para iluminar a terra,
18 E para governar o dia e a noite, e para fazer separação entre a luz e as trevas; e viu Deus que era bom.
19 E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia quarto.
20 E disse Deus: Produzam as águas abundantemente répteis de alma vivente; e voem as aves sobre a face da expansão dos céus.
21 E Deus criou as grandes baleias, e todo o réptil de alma vivente que as águas abundantemente produziram conforme as suas espécies; e toda a ave de asas conforme a sua espécie; e viu Deus que era bom.
22 E Deus os abençoou, dizendo: Frutificai e multiplicai-vos, e enchei as águas nos mares; e as aves se multipliquem na terra.
23 E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia quinto.
24 E disse Deus: Produza a terra alma vivente conforme a sua espécie; gado, e répteis e feras da terra conforme a sua espécie; e assim foi.
25 E fez Deus as feras da terra conforme a sua espécie, e o gado conforme a sua espécie, e todo o réptil da terra conforme a sua espécie; e viu Deus que era bom.
26 E disse Deus: Façamos o homem à nossa imagem, conforme a nossa semelhança; e domine sobre os peixes do mar, e sobre as aves dos céus, e sobre o gado, e sobre toda a terra, e sobre todo o réptil que se move sobre a terra.
27 E criou Deus o homem à sua imagem; à imagem de Deus o criou; homem e mulher os criou.
28 E Deus os abençoou, e Deus lhes disse: Frutificai e multiplicai-vos, e enchei a terra, e sujeitai-a; e dominai sobre os peixes do mar e sobre as aves dos céus, e sobre todo o animal que se move sobre a terra.
29 E disse Deus: Eis que vos tenho dado toda a erva que dê semente, que está sobre a face de toda a terra; e toda a árvore, em que há fruto que dê semente, ser-vos-á para mantimento.
30 E a todo o animal da terra, e a toda a ave dos céus, e a todo o réptil da terra, em que há alma vivente, toda a erva verde será para mantimento; e assim foi.
31 E viu Deus tudo quanto tinha feito, e eis que era muito bom; e foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia sexto.A PAZ DO DEUS PAI VIVO PARA SEMPRE, ALTÍSSIMO FIEL O TODO PODEROSO,SANTO,JUSTO,JUIZ, SUPREMO,DONO DE TODAS AS COISAS E DOS CÉUS.FELICIDADE,FIDELIDADE INCALCULÁVEL,INFALÍVEL, INSONDÁVEL,INABALÁVEL, INQUEBRÁVEL,ROCHEDO FORTE, ESCUDO DA FÉ,BENIGNO,PIEDOSO, DIGNO GRANDE E INESCRUTÁVEL, INCOMPARÁVEL,VERDADEIRO, BRAÇOS FORTE,BENEVOLÊNTE, IMBATÍVEL,DESTEMIVEL FIEL JUSTO, MAJESTOSO,MARAVILHOSO, INVISÍVEL E MAIS DO QUE REAL, ONISCIENTE,ONIPRESENTE, ONIPOTENTE, DEUS VIVO ALTÍSSIMO É BOM O TEMPO TODO.GLORIFICADO DEUS PAI VIVO ALTÍSSIMO FIEL O TODO PODEROSO ESTÁ ACIMA DE TODOS,E SOBRE TUDO,E SOBRE TODOS NÓS.

Santificado seja o teu nome.
10Venha o teu Reino;
seja feita a tua vontade,
assim na terra como no céu.
11Dá-nos hoje o nosso
pão de cada dia.
12Perdoa as nossas dívidas,
assim como perdoamos
aos nossos devedores.
13E não nos deixes cair
em tentação,
mas livra-nos do mal,
porque teu é o Reino, o poder e a glória para sempre. Amém.Vocês não sabem que os perversos não herdarão o Reino de Deus? Não se deixem enganar: nem imorais, nem idólatras, nem adúlteros, nem homossexuais passivos ou ativos,
10 nem ladrões, nem avarentos, nem alcoólatras, nem caluniadores, nem trapaceiros herdarão o Reino de Deus.
11 Assim foram alguns de vocês. Mas vocês foram lavados, foram santificados, foram justificados no nome do Senhor Jesus Cristo e no Espírito de nosso Deus.22 Com homem não te deitarás, como se fosse mulher; abominação é;
23 Nem te deitarás com um animal, para te contaminares com ele; nem a mulher se porá perante um animal, para ajuntar-se com ele; confusão é.
24 Com nenhuma destas coisas vos contamineis; porque com todas estas coisas se contaminaram as nações que eu expulso de diante de vós.
25 Por isso a terra está contaminada; e eu visito a sua iniquidade, e a terra vomita os seus moradores.
26 Porém vós guardareis os meus estatutos e os meus juízos, e nenhuma destas abominações fareis, nem o natural, nem o estrangeiro que peregrina entre vós
Levítico 18Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.",princ pio criou deus os us terra terra era sem forma vazia havia trevas sobre face abismo esp

2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele

""I'm leaving you"" ""No you ain't, come back"" We're running right back, here we go again It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane But when it's bad, it's awful I feel so ashamed, I snapped, ""Who's that dude?""

Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall Next time? There won't be no next time I apologize, even though I know it's lies I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar If she ever tries to fucking leave again I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?

5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele nos carrega em seus braços.Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente. Amém.Inclina, SENHOR, os teus ouvidos, e ouve-me, porque estou necessitado e aflito. 2 Guarda a minha alma, pois sou santo: ó Deus meu, salva o teu servo, que em ti confia. 3 Tem misericórdia de mim, ó Senhor, pois a ti clamo todo o dia. 4 Alegra a alma do teu servo, pois a ti, Senhor, levanto a minha alma. 5 Pois tu, Senhor, és bom, e pronto a perdoar, e abundante em benignidade para todos os que te invocam. 6 Dá ouvidos, SENHOR, à minha oração e atende à voz das minhas súplicas. 7 No dia da minha angústia clamo a ti, porquanto me respondes. 8 Entre os deuses não há semelhante a ti, Senhor, nem há obras como as tuas. 9 Todas as nações que fizeste virão e se prostrarão perante a tua face, Senhor, e glorificarão o teu nome. 10 Porque tu és grande e fazes maravilhas; só tu és Deus. 11 Ensina-me, SENHOR, o teu caminho, e andarei na tua verdade; une o meu coração ao temor do teu nome. 12 Louvar-te-ei, Senhor Deus meu, com todo o meu coração, e glorificarei o teu nome para sempre. 13 Pois grande é a tua misericórdia para comigo; e livraste a minha alma do inferno mais profunda. 14 O Deus, os soberbos se levantaram contra mim, e as assembléias dos tiranos procuraram a minha alma, e não te puseram perante os seus olhos. 15 Porém tu, Senhor, és um Deus cheio de compaixão, e piedoso, sofredor, e grande em benignidade e em verdade. 16 Volta-te para mim, e tem misericórdia de mim; dá a tua fortaleza ao teu servo, e salva ao filho da tua serva. 17 Mostra-me um sinal para bem, para que o vejam aqueles que me odeiam, e se confundam; porque tu, SENHOR, me ajudaste e me consolaste.

"Toda a ferramenta preparada contra ti não prosperará, e toda a língua que se levantar contra ti em juízo tu a condenarás; esta é a herança dos servos do Senhor, e a sua justiça que de mim procede, diz o Senhor.Para sempre, ó SENHOR, a tua palavra permanece no céu.
90	A tua fidelidade dura de geração em geração; tu firmaste a terra, e ela permanece firme.
91	Eles continuam até ao dia de hoje, segundo as tuas ordenações; porque todos são teus servos.
92	Se a tua lei não fora toda a minha recreação, há muito que pereceria na minha aflição.
93	Nunca me esquecerei dos teus preceitos; pois por eles me tens vivificado.
94	Sou teu, salva-me; pois tenho buscado os teus preceitos.
95	Os ímpios me esperam para me destruírem, mas eu considerarei os teus testemunhos.
96	Tenho visto fim a toda a perfeição, mas o teu mandamento é amplíssimo.
97	Mem. Oh! quanto amo a tua lei! É a minha meditação em todo o dia.
98	Tu, pelos teus mandamentos, me fazes mais sábio do que os meus inimigos; pois estão sempre comigo.
99	Tenho mais entendimento do que todos os meus mestres, porque os teus testemunhos são a minha meditação.
100	Entendo mais do que os antigos; porque guardo os teus preceitos.
101	Desviei os meus pés de todo caminho mau, para guardar a tua palavra.
102	Não me apartei dos teus juízos, pois tu me ensinaste.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele nos carrega em seus braços.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.

"26 Mas aquele Consolador, o Espírito Santo, que o Pai enviará em meu nome, esse vos ensinará todas as coisas, e vos fará lembrar de tudo quanto vos tenho dito.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.1 No princípio criou Deus os céus e a terra.
2 E a terra era sem forma e vazia; e havia trevas sobre a face do abismo; e o Espírito de Deus se movia sobre a face das águas.
3 E disse Deus: Haja luz; e houve luz.
4 E viu Deus que era boa a luz; e fez Deus separação entre a luz e as trevas.
5 E Deus chamou à luz Dia; e às trevas chamou Noite. E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia primeiro.
6 E disse Deus: Haja uma expansão no meio das águas, e haja separação entre águas e águas.
7 E fez Deus a expansão, e fez separação entre as águas que estavam debaixo da expansão e as águas que estavam sobre a expansão; e assim foi.
8 E chamou Deus à expansão Céus, e foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia segundo.
9 E disse Deus: Ajuntem-se as águas debaixo dos céus num lugar; e apareça a porção seca; e assim foi.
10 E chamou Deus à porção seca Terra; e ao ajuntamento das águas chamou Mares; e viu Deus que era bom.
11 E disse Deus: Produza a terra erva verde, erva que dê semente, árvore frutífera que dê fruto segundo a sua espécie, cuja semente está nela sobre a terra; e assim foi.
12 E a terra produziu erva, erva dando semente conforme a sua espécie, e a árvore frutífera, cuja semente está nela conforme a sua espécie; e viu Deus que era bom.
13 E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia terceiro.
14 E disse Deus: Haja luminares na expansão dos céus, para haver separação entre o dia e a noite; e sejam eles para sinais e para tempos determinados e para dias e anos.
15 E sejam para luminares na expansão dos céus, para iluminar a terra; e assim foi.
16 E fez Deus os dois grandes luminares: o luminar maior para governar o dia, e o luminar menor para governar a noite; e fez as estrelas.
17 E Deus os pôs na expansão dos céus para iluminar a terra,
18 E para governar o dia e a noite, e para fazer separação entre a luz e as trevas; e viu Deus que era bom.
19 E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia quarto.
20 E disse Deus: Produzam as águas abundantemente répteis de alma vivente; e voem as aves sobre a face da expansão dos céus.
21 E Deus criou as grandes baleias, e todo o réptil de alma vivente que as águas abundantemente produziram conforme as suas espécies; e toda a ave de asas conforme a sua espécie; e viu Deus que era bom.
22 E Deus os abençoou, dizendo: Frutificai e multiplicai-vos, e enchei as águas nos mares; e as aves se multipliquem na terra.
23 E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia quinto.
24 E disse Deus: Produza a terra alma vivente conforme a sua espécie; gado, e répteis e feras da terra conforme a sua espécie; e assim foi.
25 E fez Deus as feras da terra conforme a sua espécie, e o gado conforme a sua espécie, e todo o réptil da terra conforme a sua espécie; e viu Deus que era bom.
26 E disse Deus: Façamos o homem à nossa imagem, conforme a nossa semelhança; e domine sobre os peixes do mar, e sobre as aves dos céus, e sobre o gado, e sobre toda a terra, e sobre todo o réptil que se move sobre a terra.
27 E criou Deus o homem à sua imagem; à imagem de Deus o criou; homem e mulher os criou.
28 E Deus os abençoou, e Deus lhes disse: Frutificai e multiplicai-vos, e enchei a terra, e sujeitai-a; e dominai sobre os peixes do mar e sobre as aves dos céus, e sobre todo o animal que se move sobre a terra.
29 E disse Deus: Eis que vos tenho dado toda a erva que dê semente, que está sobre a face de toda a terra; e toda a árvore, em que há fruto que dê semente, ser-vos-á para mantimento.
30 E a todo o animal da terra, e a toda a ave dos céus, e a todo o réptil da terra, em que há alma vivente, toda a erva verde será para mantimento; e assim foi.
31 E viu Deus tudo quanto tinha feito, e eis que era muito bom; e foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia sexto.Pai nosso, que estás nos céus!
Santificado seja o teu nome.
10Venha o teu Reino;
seja feita a tua vontade,
assim na terra como no céu.
11Dá-nos hoje o nosso
pão de cada dia.
12Perdoa as nossas dívidas,
assim como perdoamos
aos nossos devedores.
13E não nos deixes cair
em tentação,
mas livra-nos do mal,
porque teu é o Reino, o poder e a glória para sempre. Amém.GLORIFICADO DEUS PAI VIVO ALTÍSSIMO FIEL O TODO PODEROSO ESTÁ ACIMA DE TODOS,E SOBRE TUDO,E SOBRE TODOS NÓS.

"1 Não se turbe o vosso coração; credes em Deus, crede também em mim.
2 Na casa de meu Pai há muitas moradas; se não fosse assim, eu vo-lo teria dito. Vou preparar-vos lugar.
3 E quando eu for, e vos preparar lugar, virei outra vez, e vos levarei para mim mesmo, para que onde eu estiver estejais vós também.
4 Mesmo vós sabeis para onde vou, e conheceis o caminho.
5 Disse-lhe Tomé: Senhor, nós não sabemos para onde vais; e como podemos saber o caminho?
6 Disse-lhe Jesus: Eu sou o caminho, e a verdade e a vida; ninguém vem ao Pai, senão por mim.
7 Se vós me conhecêsseis a mim, também conheceríeis a meu Pai; e já desde agora o conheceis, e o tendes visto.
8 Disse-lhe Filipe: Senhor, mostra-nos o Pai, o que nos basta.
9 Disse-lhe Jesus: Estou há tanto tempo convosco, e não me tendes conhecido, Filipe? Quem me vê a mim vê o Pai; e como dizes tu: Mostra-nos o Pai?
10 Não crês tu que eu estou no Pai, e que o Pai está em mim? As palavras que eu vos digo não as digo de mim mesmo, mas o Pai, que está em mim, é quem faz as obras.
11 Crede-me que estou no Pai, e o Pai em mim; crede-me, ao menos, por causa das mesmas obras.
12 Na verdade, na verdade vos digo que aquele que crê em mim também fará as obras que eu faço, e as fará maiores do que estas, porque eu vou para meu Pai.
13 E tudo quanto pedirdes em meu nome eu o farei, para que o Pai seja glorificado no Filho.
14 Se pedirdes alguma coisa em meu nome, eu o farei.
15 Se me amais, guardai os meus mandamentos.
16 E eu rogarei ao Pai, e ele vos dará outro Consolador, para que fique convosco para sempre;
17 O Espírito de verdade, que o mundo não pode receber, porque não o vê nem o conhece; mas vós o conheceis, porque habita convosco, e estará em vós.
18 Não vos deixarei órfãos; voltarei para vós.
19 Ainda um pouco, e o mundo não me verá mais, mas vós me vereis; porque eu vivo, e vós vivereis.
20 Naquele dia conhecereis que estou em meu Pai, e vós em mim, e eu em vós.
21 Aquele que tem os meus mandamentos e os guarda esse é o que me ama; e aquele que me ama será amado de meu Pai, e eu o amarei, e me manifestarei a ele.
22 Disse-lhe Judas (não o Iscariotes): Senhor, de onde vem que te hás de manifestar a nós, e não ao mundo?
23 Jesus respondeu, e disse-lhe: Se alguém me ama, guardará a minha palavra, e meu Pai o amará, e viremos para ele, e faremos nele morada.
24 Quem não me ama não guarda as minhas palavras; ora, a palavra que ouvistes não é minha, mas do Pai que me enviou.
25 Tenho-vos dito isto, estando convosco.
26 Mas aquele Consolador, o Espírito Santo, que o Pai enviará em meu nome, esse vos ensinará todas as coisas, e vos fará lembrar de tudo quanto vos tenho dito.
27 Deixo-vos a paz, a minha paz vos dou; não vo-la dou como o mundo a dá. Não se turbe o vosso coração, nem se atemorize.
28 Ouvistes que eu vos disse: Vou, e venho para vós. Se me amásseis, certamente exultaríeis porque eu disse: Vou para o Pai; porque meu Pai é maior do que eu.
29 Eu vo-lo disse agora antes que aconteça, para que, quando acontecer, vós acrediteis.
30 Já não falarei muito convosco, porque se aproxima o príncipe deste mundo, e nada tem em mim;
31 Mas é para que o mundo saiba que eu amo o Pai, e que faço como o Pai me mandou. Levantai-vos, vamo-nos daqui.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente. Amém.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele

2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.

2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.

92	Se a tua lei não fora toda a minha recreação, há muito que pereceria na minha aflição.
93	Nunca me esquecerei dos teus preceitos; pois por eles me tens vivificado.
94	Sou teu, salva-me; pois tenho buscado os teus preceitos.
95	Os ímpios me esperam para me destruírem, mas eu considerarei os teus testemunhos.
96	Tenho visto fim a toda a perfeição, mas o teu mandamento é amplíssimo.
97	Mem. Oh! quanto amo a tua lei! É a minha meditação em todo o dia.
98	Tu, pelos teus mandamentos, me fazes mais sábio do que os meus inimigos; pois estão sempre comigo.
99	Tenho mais entendimento do que todos os meus mestres, porque os teus testemunhos são a minha meditação.
100	Entendo mais do que os antigos; porque guardo os teus preceitos.
101	Desviei os meus pés de todo caminho mau, para guardar a tua palavra.
102	Não me apartei dos teus juízos, pois tu me ensinaste.Pai nosso, que estás nos céus!
Santificado seja o teu nome.
10Venha o teu Reino;
seja feita a tua vontade,
assim na terra como no céu.
11Dá-nos hoje o nosso
pão de cada dia.
12Perdoa as nossas dívidas,
assim como perdoamos
aos nossos devedores.
13E não nos deixes cair
em tentação,
mas livra-nos do mal,

3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente. Amém.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,

"Pai nosso, que estás nos céus!
Santificado seja o teu nome.
10Venha o teu Reino;
seja feita a tua vontade,
assim na terra como no céu.
11Dá-nos hoje o nosso
pão de cada dia.
12Perdoa as nossas dívidas,
assim como perdoamos
aos nossos devedores.
13E não nos deixes cair
em tentação,
mas livra-nos do mal,
porque teu é o Reino, o poder e a glória para sempre. Amém.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele nos carrega em seus braços.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.",pai nosso que est nos us santificado seja teu nome 10venha teu reino seja feita tua vontade assim na terra como 11d nos hoje nosso de cada dia 12perdoa nossas vidas assim como perdoamos aos nossos devedores 13e nos deixes cair em tenta mas livra nos mal porque teu reino poder gl ria para sempre qual deus far se cumprir devido tempo ele bendito nico soberano rei dos reis senhor dos senhores nico que imortal habita em luz inacess vel quem ningu viu nem pode ver ele sejam honra poder para sempre senhor estabeleceu seu trono nos us como rei domina sobre tudo que existe soberano senhor meu deus meu salvador tu proteges cabe dia combate louvado seja senhor louvado seja deus nosso salvador cada dia ele nos carrega em seus bra os senhor mas ao teu nome gl ria por amor da tua benignidade da tua verdade por que dir os gentios onde est seu deus mas nosso deus est nos us fez tudo que lhe agradou os dolos deles prata ouro obra das os dos homens boca mas falam olhos mas veem ouvidos mas ouvem narizes mas cheiram os mas apalpam mas andam nem som algum sai da sua garganta eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem assim como todos os que neles confiam israel confia senhor ele seu aux lio seu escudo 10 casa de ar confia senhor ele seu aux lio seu escudo 11 os que temeis ao senhor confiai senhor ele seu aux lio seu escudo 12 senhor se lembrou de ele nos aben oar aben oar casa de israel aben oar casa de ar 13 aben oar os que temem ao senhor tanto pequenos como grandes 14 senhor vos aumentar cada vez mais vossos filhos 15 sois benditos senhor que fez os us terra 16 os us os us senhor mas terra deu aos filhos dos homens 17 os mortos louvam ao senhor nem os que descem ao sil ncio 18 mas bendiremos ao senhor desde agora para sempre louvai ao senhor ent falou deus todas estas palavras dizendo eu sou senhor teu deus que te tirei da terra egito da casa da servid ter outros deuses diante de mim far para ti imagem de escultura nem alguma semelhan que em cima nos us nem embaixo na terra nem nas guas debaixo da terra te encurvar elas nem servir porque eu senhor teu deus sou deus zeloso que visito iniquidade dos pais nos filhos terceira quarta gera daqueles que odeiam fa miseric rdia milhares dos que amam aos que guardam os meus mandamentos tomar nome senhor teu deus em porque senhor ter por inocente que tomar seu nome em lembra te dia bado para santificar seis dias trabalhar far toda tua obra 10 mas timo dia bado senhor teu deus far nenhuma obra nem tu nem teu filho nem tua filha nem teu servo nem tua serva nem teu animal nem teu estrangeiro que est dentro das tuas portas 11 porque em seis dias fez senhor os us terra mar tudo que neles ao timo dia descansou portanto aben oou senhor dia bado santificou 12 honra teu pai tua para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que senhor teu deus te 13 matar 14 adulterar 15 furtar 16 dir falso testemunho contra teu pr ximo 17 cobi ar casa teu pr ximo cobi ar mulher teu pr ximo nem seu servo nem sua serva nem seu boi nem seu jumento nem coisa alguma teu pr ximo 18 todo povo viu os trov es os rel mpagos sonido da trombeta monte fumegando povo vendo isso retirou se se de longe 19 disseram mois fala tu conosco ouviremos fale deus conosco para que morramos 20 disse mois ao povo temais deus veio para vos provar para que seu temor esteja diante de fim de que pequeis 21 povo estava em de longe mois por se chegou escurid onde deus estava 22 ent disse senhor mois assim dir aos filhos de israel tendes visto que dos us eu falei convosco 23 fareis outros deuses comigo deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro fareis para 24 um altar de terra far sobre ele sacrificar os teus holocaustos tuas ofertas pac ficas tuas ovelhas tuas vacas em todo lugar onde eu fizer celebrar mem ria meu nome virei ti te aben oarei 25 se fizeres um altar de pedras far de pedras lavradas se sobre ele levantares teu buril profan lo 26 tamb subir ao meu altar por degraus para que tua nudez seja descoberta diante deles,NEUTRAL,0.059208255,0.8919012,0.04889052,0.8919012,4903,970,1,en

Santificado seja o teu nome.
10Venha o teu Reino;
seja feita a tua vontade,
assim na terra como no céu.
11Dá-nos hoje o nosso
pão de cada dia.
12Perdoa as nossas dívidas,
assim como perdoamos
aos nossos devedores.
13E não nos deixes cair
em tentação,
mas livra-nos do mal,
porque teu é o Reino, o poder e a glória para sempre. Amém.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.

2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.",soberano senhor meu deus meu salvador tu proteges cabe dia combate louvado seja senhor louvado seja deus nosso salvador cada dia ele nos carrega em seus bra os paz deus pai vivo para sempre alt ssimo fiel todo poderoso santo justo juiz supremo dono de todas coisas dos us felicidade fidelidade incalcul vel infal vel insond vel inabal vel inquebr vel rochedo forte escudo da benigno piedoso digno grande inescrut vel incompar vel verdadeiro bra os forte benevol nte imbat vel destemivel fiel justo majestoso maravilhoso invis vel mais que real resplendor onisciente onipresente onipotente deus vivo alt ssimo bom tempo todo iluminado fiel glorificado deus pai vivo alt ssimo fiel todo poderoso est acima de todos sobre tudo sobre todos glorificado deus pai vivo alt ssimo fiel todo poderoso est acima de todos sobre tudo sobre todos glorificado deus pai vivo alt ssimo fiel todo poderoso est acima de todos sobre tudo sobre todos glorificado deus pai vivo alt ssimo fiel todo poderoso est acima de todos sobre tudo sobre todos glorificado deus pai vivo alt ssimo fiel todo poderosoa paz deus pai vivo para sempre alt ssimo fiel todo poderoso santo justo juiz supremo dono de todas coisas dos us felicidade fidelidade incalcul vel infal vel insond vel inabal vel inquebr vel rochedo forte escudo da benigno piedoso digno grande inescrut vel incompar vel verdadeiro bra os forte benevol nte imbat vel destemivel fiel justo majestoso maravilhoso invis vel mais que real onisciente onipresente onipotente deus vivo alt ssimo bom tempo todo ent falou deus todas estas palavras dizendo eu sou senhor teu deus que te tirei da terra egito da casa da servid ter outros deuses diante de mim far para ti imagem de escultura nem alguma semelhan que em cima nos us nem embaixo na terra nem nas guas debaixo da terra te encurvar elas nem servir porque eu senhor teu deus sou deus zeloso que visito iniquidade dos pais nos filhos terceira quarta gera daqueles que odeiam fa miseric rdia milhares dos que amam aos que guardam os meus mandamentos tomar nome senhor teu deus em porque senhor ter por inocente que tomar seu nome em lembra te dia bado para santificar seis dias trabalhar far toda tua obra 10 mas timo dia bado senhor teu deus far nenhuma obra nem tu nem teu filho nem tua filha nem teu servo nem tua serva nem teu animal nem teu estrangeiro que est dentro das tuas portas 11 porque em seis dias fez senhor os us terra mar tudo que neles ao timo dia descansou portanto aben oou senhor dia bado santificou 12 honra teu pai tua para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que senhor teu deus te 13 matar 14 adulterar 15 furtar 16 dir falso testemunho contra teu pr ximo 17 cobi ar casa teu pr ximo cobi ar mulher teu pr ximo nem seu servo nem sua serva nem seu boi nem seu jumento nem coisa alguma teu pr ximo 18 todo povo viu os trov es os rel mpagos sonido da trombeta monte fumegando povo vendo isso retirou se se de longe 19 disseram mois fala tu conosco ouviremos fale deus conosco para que morramos 20 disse mois ao povo temais deus veio para vos provar para que seu temor esteja diante de fim de que pequeis 21 povo estava em de longe mois por se chegou escurid onde deus estava 22 ent disse senhor mois assim dir aos filhos de israel tendes visto que dos us eu falei convosco 23 fareis outros deuses comigo deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro fareis para 24 um altar de terra far sobre ele sacrificar os teus holocaustos tuas ofertas pac ficas tuas ovelhas tuas vacas em todo lugar onde eu fizer celebrar mem ria meu nome virei ti te aben oarei 25 se fizeres um altar de pedras far de pedras lavradas se sobre ele levantares teu buril profan lo 26 tamb subir ao meu altar por degraus para que tua nudez seja descoberta diante deles,NEUTRAL,0.06675034,0.8875245,0.04572516,0.8875245,4427,766,1,en

"Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele nos carrega em seus braços.Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente. Amém.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.

"Apocalipse 7
1	E depois destas coisas vi quatro anjos que estavam sobre os quatro cantos da terra, retendo os quatro ventos da terra, para que nenhum vento soprasse sobre a terra, nem sobre o mar, nem contra árvore alguma.
2	E vi outro anjo subir do lado do sol nascente, e que tinha o selo do Deus vivo; e clamou com grande voz aos quatro anjos, a quem fora dado o poder de danificar a terra e o mar,
3	Dizendo: Não danifiqueis a terra, nem o mar, nem as árvores, até que hajamos assinalado nas suas testas os servos do nosso Deus.
4	E ouvi o número dos assinalados, e eram cento e quarenta e quatro mil assinalados, de todas as tribos dos filhos de Israel.
5	Da tribo de Judá, havia doze mil assinalados; da tribo de Rúben, doze mil assinalados; da tribo de Gade, doze mil assinalados;
6	Da tribo de Aser, doze mil assinalados; da tribo de Naftali, doze mil assinalados; da tribo de Manassés, doze mil assinalados;
7	Da tribo de Simeão, doze mil assinalados; da tribo de Levi, doze mil assinalados; da tribo de Issacar, doze mil assinalados;
8	Da tribo de Zebulom, doze mil assinalados; da tribo de José, doze mil assinalados; da tribo de Benjamim, doze mil assinalados.
9	Depois destas coisas olhei, e eis aqui uma multidão, a qual ninguém podia contar, de todas as nações, e tribos, e povos, e línguas, que estavam diante do trono, e perante o Cordeiro, trajando vestes brancas e com palmas nas suas mãos;
10	E clamavam com grande voz, dizendo: Salvação ao nosso Deus, que está assentado no trono, e ao Cordeiro.
11	E todos os anjos estavam ao redor do trono, e dos anciãos, e dos quatro animais; e prostraram-se diante do trono sobre seus rostos, e adoraram a Deus,
12	Dizendo: Amém. Louvor, e glória, e sabedoria, e ação de graças, e honra, e poder, e força ao nosso Deus, para todo o sempre. Amém.
13	E um dos anciãos me falou, dizendo: Estes que estão vestidos de vestes brancas, quem são, e de onde vieram?
14	E eu disse-lhe: Senhor, tu sabes. E ele disse-me: Estes são os que vieram da grande tribulação, e lavaram as suas vestes e as branquearam no sangue do Cordeiro.
15	Por isso estão diante do trono de Deus, e o servem de dia e de noite no seu templo; e aquele que está assentado sobre o trono os cobrirá com a sua sombra.
16	Nunca mais terão fome, nunca mais terão sede; nem sol nem calma alguma cairá sobre eles.
17	Porque o Cordeiro que está no meio do trono os apascentará, e lhes servirá de guia para as fontes das águas da vida; e Deus limpará de seus olhos toda a lágrima.GLORIFICADO DEUS PAI VIVO ALTÍSSIMO FIEL O TODO PODEROSO ESTÁ ACIMA DE TODOS,E SOBRE TUDO,E SOBRE TODOS NÓS.

Santificado seja o teu nome.
10Venha o teu Reino;
seja feita a tua vontade,
assim na terra como no céu.
11Dá-nos hoje o nosso
pão de cada dia.
12Perdoa as nossas dívidas,
assim como perdoamos
aos nossos devedores.
13E não nos deixes cair
em tentação,
mas livra-nos do mal,
porque teu é o Reino, o poder e a glória para sempre. Amém.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre.

Santificado seja o teu nome.
10Venha o teu Reino;
seja feita a tua vontade,
assim na terra como no céu.
11Dá-nos hoje o nosso
pão de cada dia.
12Perdoa as nossas dívidas,
assim como perdoamos
aos nossos devedores.
13E não nos deixes cair
em tentação,
mas livra-nos do mal,
porque teu é o Reino, o poder e a glória para sempre. Amém.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente. Amém.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele

"DEUS PAI VIVO ALTÍSSIMO FIEL O TODO PODEROSO SUPREMO CRIADOR IMORTAL SANTO que está ACIMA DE TUDO E SOBRE TODOS nós, disse DEUS VIVO que haja batalha no céu:Miguel e os seus anjos batalhavam contra o dragão; e batalhavam o dragão e os seus anjos, 8  não prevaleceram; nem mais o seu lugar se achou nos céus. 9 E foi precipitado o grande dragão, a antiga serpente, chamada o diabo e Satanás, que engana todo o mundo; ele foi precipitado na terra, e os seus anjos foram lançados com ele. 10 E ouvi uma grande voz no céuA qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele nos carrega em seus braços.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.

17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.",deus pai vivo alt ssimo fiel todo poderoso supremo criador imortal santo que est acima de tudo

2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente. Amém.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,

2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,

2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele

"1 Não se turbe o vosso coração; credes em Deus, crede também em mim.
2 Na casa de meu Pai há muitas moradas; se não fosse assim, eu vo-lo teria dito. Vou preparar-vos lugar.
3 E quando eu for, e vos preparar lugar, virei outra vez, e vos levarei para mim mesmo, para que onde eu estiver estejais vós também.
4 Mesmo vós sabeis para onde vou, e conheceis o caminho.
5 Disse-lhe Tomé: Senhor, nós não sabemos para onde vais; e como podemos saber o caminho?
6 Disse-lhe Jesus: Eu sou o caminho, e a verdade e a vida; ninguém vem ao Pai, senão por mim.
7 Se vós me conhecêsseis a mim, também conheceríeis a meu Pai; e já desde agora o conheceis, e o tendes visto.
8 Disse-lhe Filipe: Senhor, mostra-nos o Pai, o que nos basta.
9 Disse-lhe Jesus: Estou há tanto tempo convosco, e não me tendes conhecido, Filipe? Quem me vê a mim vê o Pai; e como dizes tu: Mostra-nos o Pai?
10 Não crês tu que eu estou no Pai, e que o Pai está em mim? As palavras que eu vos digo não as digo de mim mesmo, mas o Pai, que está em mim, é quem faz as obras.
11 Crede-me que estou no Pai, e o Pai em mim; crede-me, ao menos, por causa das mesmas obras.
12 Na verdade, na verdade vos digo que aquele que crê em mim também fará as obras que eu faço, e as fará maiores do que estas, porque eu vou para meu Pai.
13 E tudo quanto pedirdes em meu nome eu o farei, para que o Pai seja glorificado no Filho.
14 Se pedirdes alguma coisa em meu nome, eu o farei.
15 Se me amais, guardai os meus mandamentos.
16 E eu rogarei ao Pai, e ele vos dará outro Consolador, para que fique convosco para sempre;
17 O Espírito de verdade, que o mundo não pode receber, porque não o vê nem o conhece; mas vós o conheceis, porque habita convosco, e estará em vós.
18 Não vos deixarei órfãos; voltarei para vós.
19 Ainda um pouco, e o mundo não me verá mais, mas vós me vereis; porque eu vivo, e vós vivereis.
20 Naquele dia conhecereis que estou em meu Pai, e vós em mim, e eu em vós.
21 Aquele que tem os meus mandamentos e os guarda esse é o que me ama; e aquele que me ama será amado de meu Pai, e eu o amarei, e me manifestarei a ele.
22 Disse-lhe Judas (não o Iscariotes): Senhor, de onde vem que te hás de manifestar a nós, e não ao mundo?
23 Jesus respondeu, e disse-lhe: Se alguém me ama, guardará a minha palavra, e meu Pai o amará, e viremos para ele, e faremos nele morada.
24 Quem não me ama não guarda as minhas palavras; ora, a palavra que ouvistes não é minha, mas do Pai que me enviou.
25 Tenho-vos dito isto, estando convosco.
26 Mas aquele Consolador, o Espírito Santo, que o Pai enviará em meu nome, esse vos ensinará todas as coisas, e vos fará lembrar de tudo quanto vos tenho dito.
27 Deixo-vos a paz, a minha paz vos dou; não vo-la dou como o mundo a dá. Não se turbe o vosso coração, nem se atemorize.
28 Ouvistes que eu vos disse: Vou, e venho para vós. Se me amásseis, certamente exultaríeis porque eu disse: Vou para o Pai; porque meu Pai é maior do que eu.
29 Eu vo-lo disse agora antes que aconteça, para que, quando acontecer, vós acrediteis.
30 Já não falarei muito convosco, porque se aproxima o príncipe deste mundo, e nada tem em mim;
31 Mas é para que o mundo saiba que eu amo o Pai, e que faço como o Pai me mandou. Levantai-vos, vamo-nos daqui.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele nos carrega em seus braços.Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente. Amém.Ora, a fé é o firme fundamento das coisas que se esperam, e a prova das coisas que não se veem.
2 Porque por ela os antigos alcançaram testemunho.
3 Pela fé entendemos que os mundos pela palavra de Deus foram criados; de maneira que aquilo que se vê não foi feito do que é aparente.
4 Pela fé Abel ofereceu a Deus maior sacrifício do que Caim, pelo qual alcançou testemunho de que era justo, dando Deus testemunho dos seus dons, e por ela, depois de morto, ainda fala.
5 Pela fé Enoque foi trasladado para não ver a morte, e não foi achado, porque Deus o trasladara; visto como antes da sua trasladação alcançou testemunho de que agradara a Deus.
6 Ora, sem fé é impossível agradar-lhe; porque é necessário que aquele que se aproxima de Deus creia que ele existe, e que é galardoador dos que o buscam.",se turbe vosso cora credes em deus crede

10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.

"16	Porque não me envergonho do evangelho de Cristo, pois é o poder de Deus para salvação de todo aquele que crê; primeiro do judeu, e também do grego.
17	Porque nele se descobre a justiça de Deus de fé em fé, como está escrito: Mas o justo viverá da fé.
18	Porque do céu se manifesta a ira de Deus sobre toda a impiedade e injustiça dos homens, que detêm a verdade em injustiça.
19	Porquanto o que de Deus se pode conhecer neles se manifesta, porque Deus lho manifestou.
20	Porque as suas coisas invisíveis, desde a criação do mundo, tanto o seu eterno poder, como a sua divindade, se entendem, e claramente se vêem pelas coisas que estão criadas, para que eles fiquem inescusáveis;
21	Porquanto, tendo conhecido a Deus, não o glorificaram como Deus, nem lhe deram graças, antes em seus discursos se desvaneceram, e o seu coração insensato se obscureceu.
22	Dizendo-se sábios, tornaram-se loucos.
23	E mudaram a glória do Deus incorruptível em semelhança da imagem de homem corruptível, e de aves, e de quadrúpedes, e de répteis.
24	Por isso também Deus os entregou às concupiscências de seus corações, à imundícia, para desonrarem seus corpos entre si;
25	Pois mudaram a verdade de Deus em mentira, e honraram e serviram mais a criatura do que o Criador, que é bendito eternamente. Amém.
26	Por isso Deus os abandonou às paixões infames. Porque até as suas mulheres mudaram o uso natural, no contrário à natureza.
27	E, semelhantemente, também os homens, deixando o uso natural da mulher, se inflamaram em sua sensualidade uns para com os outros, homens com homens, cometendo torpeza e recebendo em si mesmos a recompensa que convinha ao seu erro.
28	E, como eles não se importaram de ter conhecimento de Deus, assim Deus os entregou a um sentimento perverso, para fazerem coisas que não convêm;
29	Estando cheios de toda a iniqüidade, prostituição, malícia, avareza, maldade; cheios de inveja, homicídio, contenda, engano, malignidade;
30	Sendo murmuradores, detratores, aborrecedores de Deus, injuriadores, soberbos, presunçosos, inventores de males, desobedientes aos pais e às mães;
31	Néscios, infiéis nos contratos, sem afeição natural, irreconciliáveis, sem misericórdia;
32	Os quais, conhecendo a justiça de Deus (que são dignos de morte os que tais coisas praticam), não somente as fazem, mas também consentem aos que as fazem.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Louvado seja o Senhor; louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador! A cada dia ele nos carrega em seus braços.DEUS PAI VIVO ALTÍSSIMO FIEL O TODO PODEROSO,CRIADOR,PERFEITO,

"I am learning English and I love this music! <3. Here is my Spanish translation:
Encontré un amor para mí
Cariño, sólo sumérgete
Y sigue mi ejemplo
Bueno, encontré una chica, hermosa y dulce
Nunca supe que eras alguien que me esperaba

Porque éramos sólo niños cuando nos enamoramos
Sin saber lo que era
No te dejaré ir esta vez
Cariño, sólo bésame lento
Tu corazón es todo lo que tengo
Y en tus ojos, se reflejan los míos

Bebé, estoy bailando en la oscuridad contigo en mis brazos
Descalzo en la hierba
Estamos escuchando nuestra canción favorita
Cuando dijiste que eras un desastre
Susurré por debajo de mi aliento
Pero lo escuchaste
Cariño, esta noche te ves perfecta

Bueno, encontré una mujer, más fuerte que cualquiera que conozco
Ella comparte mis sueños
Espero que algún día compartiré su hogar
Encontré un amor, para llevar más que mis secretos
Para llevar amor, para llevar a nuestros propios hijos

Todavía somos niños, pero estamos tan enamorados
Luchando contra viento y marea
Sé que esta vez estaremos bien
Cariño, sólo coge mi mano
Sé mi mujer, yo seré tu hombre
Veo mi futuro en tus ojos

2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.

"I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes you're holding mine
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess
I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it,
Darling, you look perfect tonight
Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress
Looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this
Darling, you look perfect tonight
No, no, no
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see

"Salmos 84
1Quão amáveis são os teus tabernáculos, SENHOR dos Exércitos!
2	A minha alma está desejosa, e desfalece pelos átrios do SENHOR; o meu coração e a minha carne clamam pelo Deus vivo.
3	Até o pardal encontrou casa, e a andorinha ninho para si, onde ponha seus filhos, até mesmo nos teus altares, SENHOR dos Exércitos, Rei meu e Deus meu.
4	Bem-aventurados os que habitam em tua casa; louvar-te-ão continuamente. (Selá.)
5	Bem-aventurado o homem cuja força está em ti, em cujo coração estão os caminhos aplanados.
6	Que, passando pelo vale de Baca, faz dele uma fonte; a chuva também enche os tanques.
7	Vão indo de força em força; cada um deles em Sião aparece perante Deus.
8	SENHOR Deus dos Exércitos, escuta a minha oração; inclina os ouvidos, ó Deus de Jacó! (Selá.)
9	Olha, ó Deus, escudo nosso, e contempla o rosto do teu ungido.
10	Porque vale mais um dia nos teus átrios do que mil. Preferiria estar à porta da casa do meu Deus, a habitar nas tendas dos ímpios.
11	Porque o SENHOR Deus é um sol e escudo; o SENHOR dará graça e glória; não retirará bem algum aos que andam na retidão.
12	SENHOR dos Exércitos, bem-aventurado o homem que em ti põe a sua confiança.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente. Amém.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém

2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente. Amém.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele

Santificado seja o teu nome.
10Venha o teu Reino;
seja feita a tua vontade,
assim na terra como no céu.
11Dá-nos hoje o nosso
pão de cada dia.
12Perdoa as nossas dívidas,
assim como perdoamos
aos nossos devedores.
13E não nos deixes cair
em tentação,
mas livra-nos do mal,
porque teu é o Reino, o poder e a glória para sempre. Amém.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.",paz deus pai vivo para sempre alt ssimo fiel todo poderoso santo justo juiz supremo dono de

17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:

11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.

Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal

Ay, ¡Fonsi! ¡D.Y.!
Ohhh, oh, no, oh, no, oh
Hey, yeah! Dididiri Daddy, go!

Sí, sabes que ya llevo un rato mirándote
Tengo que bailar contigo hoy
(¡D.Y.!) Vi que tu mirada ya estaba llamándome
Muéstrame el camino que yo voy

Oh, tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Sólo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (oh, yeah!)
Ya, ya me está gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro

(Des-pa-cito) Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
(Des-pa-cito) Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
(Sube, sube, sube, sube, sube)

Quiero ver bailar tu pelo
Quiero ser tu ritmo
Que le enseñes a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos (favorito, favorito, baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro
Hasta provocar tus gritos
Y que olvides tu apellido

Si te pido un beso, ven, dámelo
Yo sé que estás pensándolo
Llevo tiempo intentándolo
Mami, esto es dando y dándolo
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bang-bang
Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bang-bang
Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empecemos lento, después salvaje

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza (¡Oye!)

(Des-pa-cito) Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
(Des-pa-cito) Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
(Sube, sube, sube, sube, sube)

Quiero ver bailar tu pelo
Quiero ser tu ritmo
Que le enseñes a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos (favorito, favorito, baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro
Hasta provocar tus gritos
Y que olvides tu apellido

Des-pa-cito
Vamo' a hacerlo en una playa en Puerto Rico
Hasta que las olas griten ""¡Ay, Bendito!""
Para que mi sello se quede contigo (¡Bailalo!)

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Que le enseñes a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos (favorito, favorito, baby)
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Hasta provocar tus gritos (Fonsi) Y que olvides tu apellido (D.Y.)

10Venha o teu Reino;
seja feita a tua vontade,
assim na terra como no céu.
11Dá-nos hoje o nosso
pão de cada dia.
12Perdoa as nossas dívidas,
assim como perdoamos
aos nossos devedores.
13E não nos deixes cair
em tentação,
mas livra-nos do mal,
porque teu é o Reino, o poder e a glória para sempre. Amém.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente. Amém.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,

"26 Mas aquele Consolador, o Espírito Santo, que o Pai enviará em meu nome, esse vos ensinará todas as coisas, e vos fará lembrar de tudo quanto vos tenho dito.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Pai nosso, que estás nos céus!
Santificado seja o teu nome.
10Venha o teu Reino;
seja feita a tua vontade,
assim na terra como no céu.
11Dá-nos hoje o nosso
pão de cada dia.
12Perdoa as nossas dívidas,
assim como perdoamos
aos nossos devedores.
13E não nos deixes cair
em tentação,
mas livra-nos do mal,
porque teu é o Reino, o poder e a glória para sempre. Amém.GLORIFICADO DEUS PAI VIVO ALTÍSSIMO FIEL O TODO PODEROSO ESTÁ ACIMA DE TODOS,E SOBRE TUDO,E SOBRE TODOS NÓS.

2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.

7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele nos carrega em seus braços.Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente. Amém.Ora, a fé é o firme fundamento das coisas que se esperam, e a prova das coisas que não se veem.
2 Porque por ela os antigos alcançaram testemunho.
3 Pela fé entendemos que os mundos pela palavra de Deus foram criados; de maneira que aquilo que se vê não foi feito do que é aparente.
4 Pela fé Abel ofereceu a Deus maior sacrifício do que Caim, pelo qual alcançou testemunho de que era justo, dando Deus testemunho dos seus dons, e por ela, depois de morto, ainda fala.
5 Pela fé Enoque foi trasladado para não ver a morte, e não foi achado, porque Deus o trasladara; visto como antes da sua trasladação alcançou testemunho de que agradara a Deus.
6 Ora, sem fé é impossível agradar-lhe; porque é necessário que aquele que se aproxima de Deus creia que ele existe, e que é galardoador dos que o buscam.Inclina, SENHOR, os teus ouvidos, e ouve-me, porque estou necessitado e aflito. 2 Guarda a minha alma, pois sou santo: ó Deus meu, salva o teu servo, que em ti confia. 3 Tem misericórdia de mim, ó Senhor, pois a ti clamo todo o dia. 4 Alegra a alma do teu servo, pois a ti, Senhor, levanto a minha alma. 5 Pois tu, Senhor, és bom, e pronto a perdoar, e abundante em benignidade para todos os que te invocam. 6 Dá ouvidos, SENHOR, à minha oração e atende à voz das minhas súplicas. 7 No dia da minha angústia clamo a ti, porquanto me respondes. 8 Entre os deuses não há semelhante a ti, Senhor, nem há obras como as tuas. 9 Todas as nações que fizeste virão e se prostrarão perante a tua face, Senhor, e glorificarão o teu nome. 10 Porque tu és grande e fazes maravilhas; só tu és Deus. 11 Ensina-me, SENHOR, o teu caminho, e andarei na tua verdade; une o meu coração ao temor do teu nome. 12 Louvar-te-ei, Senhor Deus meu, com todo o meu coração, e glorificarei o teu nome para sempre. 13 Pois grande é a tua misericórdia para comigo; e livraste a minha alma do inferno mais profunda. 14 O Deus, os soberbos se levantaram contra mim, e as assembléias dos tiranos procuraram a minha alma, e não te puseram perante os seus olhos. 15 Porém tu, Senhor, és um Deus cheio de compaixão, e piedoso, sofredor, e grande em benignidade e em verdade. 16 Volta-te para mim, e tem misericórdia de mim; dá a tua fortaleza ao teu servo, e salva ao filho da tua serva. 17 Mostra-me um sinal para bem, para que o vejam aqueles que me odeiam, e se confundam; porque tu, SENHOR, me ajudaste e me consolaste.

GLORIFICADO DEUS PAI VIVO ALTÍSSIMO FIEL O TODO PODEROSO1 No princípio criou Deus os céus e a terra.
2 E a terra era sem forma e vazia; e havia trevas sobre a face do abismo; e o Espírito de Deus se movia sobre a face das águas.
3 E disse Deus: Haja luz; e houve luz.
4 E viu Deus que era boa a luz; e fez Deus separação entre a luz e as trevas.
5 E Deus chamou à luz Dia; e às trevas chamou Noite. E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia primeiro.
6 E disse Deus: Haja uma expansão no meio das águas, e haja separação entre águas e águas.
7 E fez Deus a expansão, e fez separação entre as águas que estavam debaixo da expansão e as águas que estavam sobre a expansão; e assim foi.
8 E chamou Deus à expansão Céus, e foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia segundo.
9 E disse Deus: Ajuntem-se as águas debaixo dos céus num lugar; e apareça a porção seca; e assim foi.
10 E chamou Deus à porção seca Terra; e ao ajuntamento das águas chamou Mares; e viu Deus que era bom.
11 E disse Deus: Produza a terra erva verde, erva que dê semente, árvore frutífera que dê fruto segundo a sua espécie, cuja semente está nela sobre a terra; e assim foi.
12 E a terra produziu erva, erva dando semente conforme a sua espécie, e a árvore frutífera, cuja semente está nela conforme a sua espécie; e viu Deus que era bom.
13 E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia terceiro.
14 E disse Deus: Haja luminares na expansão dos céus, para haver separação entre o dia e a noite; e sejam eles para sinais e para tempos determinados e para dias e anos.
15 E sejam para luminares na expansão dos céus, para iluminar a terra; e assim foi.
16 E fez Deus os dois grandes luminares: o luminar maior para governar o dia, e o luminar menor para governar a noite; e fez as estrelas.
17 E Deus os pôs na expansão dos céus para iluminar a terra,
18 E para governar o dia e a noite, e para fazer separação entre a luz e as trevas; e viu Deus que era bom.
19 E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia quarto.
20 E disse Deus: Produzam as águas abundantemente répteis de alma vivente; e voem as aves sobre a face da expansão dos céus.
21 E Deus criou as grandes baleias, e todo o réptil de alma vivente que as águas abundantemente produziram conforme as suas espécies; e toda a ave de asas conforme a sua espécie; e viu Deus que era bom.
22 E Deus os abençoou, dizendo: Frutificai e multiplicai-vos, e enchei as águas nos mares; e as aves se multipliquem na terra.
23 E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia quinto.
24 E disse Deus: Produza a terra alma vivente conforme a sua espécie; gado, e répteis e feras da terra conforme a sua espécie; e assim foi.
25 E fez Deus as feras da terra conforme a sua espécie, e o gado conforme a sua espécie, e todo o réptil da terra conforme a sua espécie; e viu Deus que era bom.
26 E disse Deus: Façamos o homem à nossa imagem, conforme a nossa semelhança; e domine sobre os peixes do mar, e sobre as aves dos céus, e sobre o gado, e sobre toda a terra, e sobre todo o réptil que se move sobre a terra.
27 E criou Deus o homem à sua imagem; à imagem de Deus o criou; homem e mulher os criou.
28 E Deus os abençoou, e Deus lhes disse: Frutificai e multiplicai-vos, e enchei a terra, e sujeitai-a; e dominai sobre os peixes do mar e sobre as aves dos céus, e sobre todo o animal que se move sobre a terra.
29 E disse Deus: Eis que vos tenho dado toda a erva que dê semente, que está sobre a face de toda a terra; e toda a árvore, em que há fruto que dê semente, ser-vos-á para mantimento.
30 E a todo o animal da terra, e a toda a ave dos céus, e a todo o réptil da terra, em que há alma vivente, toda a erva verde será para mantimento; e assim foi.
31 E viu Deus tudo quanto tinha feito, e eis que era muito bom; e foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia sexto.Pai nosso, que estás nos céus!
Santificado seja o teu nome.
10Venha o teu Reino;
seja feita a tua vontade,
assim na terra como no céu.
11Dá-nos hoje o nosso
pão de cada dia.
12Perdoa as nossas dívidas,
assim como perdoamos
aos nossos devedores.
13E não nos deixes cair
em tentação,
mas livra-nos do mal,
porque teu é o Reino, o poder e a glória para sempre. Amém.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele

"Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador, tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor; louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador! A cada dia ele nos carrega em seus braços. Toda a ferramenta preparada contra ti não prosperará, e toda a língua que se levantar contra ti em juízo tu a condenarás; esta é a herança dos servos do Senhor, e a sua justiça que de mim procede, diz o Senhor.A PAZ DO DEUS PAI VIVO PARA SEMPRE, ALTÍSSIMO FIEL O TODO PODEROSO,SANTO,JUSTO,JUIZ, SUPREMO,DONO DE TODAS AS COISAS E DOS CÉUS.FELICIDADE,FIDELIDADE INCALCULÁVEL,INFALÍVEL, INSONDÁVEL,INABALÁVEL, INQUEBRÁVEL,ROCHEDO FORTE, ESCUDO DA FÉ,BENIGNO,PIEDOSO, DIGNO GRANDE E INESCRUTÁVEL, INCOMPARÁVEL,VERDADEIRO, BRAÇOS FORTE,BENEVOLÊNTE, IMBATÍVEL,DESTEMIVEL FIEL JUSTO, MAJESTOSO,MARAVILHOSO, INVISÍVEL E MAIS DO QUE REAL,RESPLENDOR, ONISCIENTE,ONIPRESENTE, ONIPOTENTE, DEUS VIVO ALTÍSSIMO É BOM O TEMPO TODO ILUMINADO FIEL.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente. Amém.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,

2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu

A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém

17	Porque nele se descobre a justiça de Deus de fé em fé, como está escrito: Mas o justo viverá da fé.
18	Porque do céu se manifesta a ira de Deus sobre toda a impiedade e injustiça dos homens, que detêm a verdade em injustiça.
19	Porquanto o que de Deus se pode conhecer neles se manifesta, porque Deus lho manifestou.
20	Porque as suas coisas invisíveis, desde a criação do mundo, tanto o seu eterno poder, como a sua divindade, se entendem, e claramente se vêem pelas coisas que estão criadas, para que eles fiquem inescusáveis;
21	Porquanto, tendo conhecido a Deus, não o glorificaram como Deus, nem lhe deram graças, antes em seus discursos se desvaneceram, e o seu coração insensato se obscureceu.
22	Dizendo-se sábios, tornaram-se loucos.
23	E mudaram a glória do Deus incorruptível em semelhança da imagem de homem corruptível, e de aves, e de quadrúpedes, e de répteis.
24	Por isso também Deus os entregou às concupiscências de seus corações, à imundícia, para desonrarem seus corpos entre si;
25	Pois mudaram a verdade de Deus em mentira, e honraram e serviram mais a criatura do que o Criador, que é bendito eternamente. Amém.
26	Por isso Deus os abandonou às paixões infames. Porque até as suas mulheres mudaram o uso natural, no contrário à natureza.
27	E, semelhantemente, também os homens, deixando o uso natural da mulher, se inflamaram em sua sensualidade uns para com os outros, homens com homens, cometendo torpeza e recebendo em si mesmos a recompensa que convinha ao seu erro.
28	E, como eles não se importaram de ter conhecimento de Deus, assim Deus os entregou a um sentimento perverso, para fazerem coisas que não convêm;
29	Estando cheios de toda a iniqüidade, prostituição, malícia, avareza, maldade; cheios de inveja, homicídio, contenda, engano, malignidade;
30	Sendo murmuradores, detratores, aborrecedores de Deus, injuriadores, soberbos, presunçosos, inventores de males, desobedientes aos pais e às mães;
31	Néscios, infiéis nos contratos, sem afeição natural, irreconciliáveis, sem misericórdia;
32	Os quais, conhecendo a justiça de Deus (que são dignos de morte os que tais coisas praticam), não somente as fazem, mas também consentem aos que as fazem.1 Não se turbe o vosso coração; credes em Deus, crede também em mim.
2 Na casa de meu Pai há muitas moradas; se não fosse assim, eu vo-lo teria dito. Vou preparar-vos lugar.
3 E quando eu for, e vos preparar lugar, virei outra vez, e vos levarei para mim mesmo, para que onde eu estiver estejais vós também.
4 Mesmo vós sabeis para onde vou, e conheceis o caminho.
5 Disse-lhe Tomé: Senhor, nós não sabemos para onde vais; e como podemos saber o caminho?
6 Disse-lhe Jesus: Eu sou o caminho, e a verdade e a vida; ninguém vem ao Pai, senão por mim.
7 Se vós me conhecêsseis a mim, também conheceríeis a meu Pai; e já desde agora o conheceis, e o tendes visto.
8 Disse-lhe Filipe: Senhor, mostra-nos o Pai, o que nos basta.
9 Disse-lhe Jesus: Estou há tanto tempo convosco, e não me tendes conhecido, Filipe? Quem me vê a mim vê o Pai; e como dizes tu: Mostra-nos o Pai?
10 Não crês tu que eu estou no Pai, e que o Pai está em mim? As palavras que eu vos digo não as digo de mim mesmo, mas o Pai, que está em mim, é quem faz as obras.
11 Crede-me que estou no Pai, e o Pai em mim; crede-me, ao menos, por causa das mesmas obras.
12 Na verdade, na verdade vos digo que aquele que crê em mim também fará as obras que eu faço, e as fará maiores do que estas, porque eu vou para meu Pai.
13 E tudo quanto pedirdes em meu nome eu o farei, para que o Pai seja glorificado no Filho.
14 Se pedirdes alguma coisa em meu nome, eu o farei.
15 Se me amais, guardai os meus mandamentos.
16 E eu rogarei ao Pai, e ele vos dará outro Consolador, para que fique convosco para sempre;
17 O Espírito de verdade, que o mundo não pode receber, porque não o vê nem o conhece; mas vós o conheceis, porque habita convosco, e estará em vós.
18 Não vos deixarei órfãos; voltarei para vós.
19 Ainda um pouco, e o mundo não me verá mais, mas vós me vereis; porque eu vivo, e vós vivereis.
20 Naquele dia conhecereis que estou em meu Pai, e vós em mim, e eu em vós.
21 Aquele que tem os meus mandamentos e os guarda esse é o que me ama; e aquele que me ama será amado de meu Pai, e eu o amarei, e me manifestarei a ele.
22 Disse-lhe Judas (não o Iscariotes): Senhor, de onde vem que te hás de manifestar a nós, e não ao mundo?
23 Jesus respondeu, e disse-lhe: Se alguém me ama, guardará a minha palavra, e meu Pai o amará, e viremos para ele, e faremos nele morada.
24 Quem não me ama não guarda as minhas palavras; ora, a palavra que ouvistes não é minha, mas do Pai que me enviou.
25 Tenho-vos dito isto, estando convosco.
26 Mas aquele Consolador, o Espírito Santo, que o Pai enviará em meu nome, esse vos ensinará todas as coisas, e vos fará lembrar de tudo quanto vos tenho dito.
27 Deixo-vos a paz, a minha paz vos dou; não vo-la dou como o mundo a dá. Não se turbe o vosso coração, nem se atemorize.
28 Ouvistes que eu vos disse: Vou, e venho para vós. Se me amásseis, certamente exultaríeis porque eu disse: Vou para o Pai; porque meu Pai é maior do que eu.
29 Eu vo-lo disse agora antes que aconteça, para que, quando acontecer, vós acrediteis.
30 Já não falarei muito convosco, porque se aproxima o príncipe deste mundo, e nada tem em mim;
31 Mas é para que o mundo saiba que eu amo o Pai, e que faço como o Pai me mandou. Levantai-vos, vamo-nos daqui.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.

"bro i’m high as FUCK rn n yoo this song has so much fuckin meaning of the lyrics and video, like the whole time i was like “ahh it’s js abt a toxic relationship” but dawg, when you really sit with it, it’s deeper than that. It’s not even about just two people fighting. It’s about how humans get addicted to the familiar, even when the familiar is killing them. Like, Eminem ain’t glorifying the chaos, he’s exposing that scary part of love where pain starts feeling normal, and once something becomes normal, your brain stops calling it wrong. That’s the real punch of the song. It ain’t about violence it’s about comfort in destruction. and the wild part is the fire metaphor, Everybody thinks the fire represents anger, but in reality the fire is honesty. Fire burns, but it also shows you what’s real, because everything fake melts in it. When Rihanna says “Just gonna stand there and watch me burn,” she’s not talking about some movie drama. She’s talking about when someone harms you emotionally and you don’t leave, not because you’re weak, but because part of you believes the burn means they care. That’s the type of truth nobody wants to admit sometimes people would rather feel something painful than feel nothing at all. OK BUT FINALLY!!  the real twist nobody catches? The song isn’t even about a relationship with a person it’s a mirror of Eminem’s relationship with himself. The anger, the relapse energy, the self sabotage… He’s basically talking to the part of him he keeps trying to destroy but can’t let go of. When he says “If she ever tries to fuckin’ leave again, I’ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire,” that’s not just rage that’s how people treat their own habits. Like, “I’d rather burn everything than face the emptiness without it.” That hits on a level most people are scared to admit out loud.",bro high fuck rn yoo song much fuckin meaning lyrics video like whole time like ahh js abt toxic relationship dawg really sit deeper even two people fighting humans get addicted familiar even familiar killing like eminem glorifying chaos exposing scary part love pain starts feeling normal something becomes normal brain stops calling wrong real punch song violence comfort destruction wild part fire metaphor everybody thinks fire represents anger reality fire honesty fire burns also shows real everything fake melts rihanna says gon na stand watch burn talking movie drama talking someone harms emotionally leave weak part believes burn means care type truth nobody wants admit sometimes people would rather feel something painful feel nothing ok finally real twist nobody catches song even relationship person mirror eminem relationship anger relapse energy self sabotage basically talking part keeps trying destroy let go says ever tries fuckin leave tie bed set house fire rage people treat habits like rather burn everything face emptiness without hits level people scared admit loud,NEGATIVE,0.8522572,0.13676012,0.010982766,0.8522572,1835,327,1,en

Toda a ferramenta preparada contra ti não prosperará, e toda a língua que se levantar contra ti em juízo tu a condenarás; esta é a herança dos servos do Senhor, e a sua justiça que de mim procede, diz o Senhor.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente. Amém.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém

Salmos 140
1	[Salmo de Davi para o músico-mor] Livra-me, ó SENHOR, do homem mau; guarda-me do homem violento,
2	Que pensa o mal no coração; continuamente se ajuntam para a guerra.
3	Aguçaram as línguas como a serpente; o veneno das víboras está debaixo dos seus lábios. (Selá.)
4	Guarda-me, ó SENHOR, das mãos do ímpio; guarda-me do homem violento; os quais se propuseram transtornar os meus passos.
5	Os soberbos armaram-me laços e cordas; estenderam a rede ao lado do caminho; armaram-me laços corrediços. (Selá.)
6	Eu disse ao SENHOR: Tu és o meu Deus; ouve a voz das minhas súplicas, ó SENHOR.
7	O DEUS o Senhor, fortaleza da minha salvação, tu cobriste a minha cabeça no dia da batalha.
8	Não concedas, ó SENHOR, ao ímpio os seus desejos; não promovas o seu mau propósito, para que não se exalte. (Selá.)
9	Quanto à cabeça dos que me cercam, cubra-os a maldade dos seus lábios.
10	Caiam sobre eles brasas vivas; sejam lançados no fogo, em covas profundas, para que se não tornem a levantar.
11	Não terá firmeza na terra o homem de má língua; o mal perseguirá o homem violento até que seja desterrado.
12	Sei que o SENHOR sustentará a causa do oprimido, e o direito do necessitado.

"Pai nosso, que estás nos céus!
Santificado seja o teu nome.
10Venha o teu Reino;
seja feita a tua vontade,
assim na terra como no céu.
11Dá-nos hoje o nosso
pão de cada dia.
12Perdoa as nossas dívidas,
assim como perdoamos
aos nossos devedores.
13E não nos deixes cair
em tentação,
mas livra-nos do mal,
porque teu é o Reino, o poder e a glória para sempre. Amém.DEUS PAI VIVO ALTÍSSIMO FIEL O TODO PODEROSO QUE ESTA ACIMA DE TUDO E SOBRE TODOS disse:Tudo tem o seu tempo determinado, e há tempo para todo o propósito debaixo do céu: 2 há tempo de nascer e tempo de morrer; tempo de plantar e tempo de arrancar o que se plantou; 3 tempo de matar e tempo de curar; tempo de derribar e tempo de edificar; 4 tempo de chorar e tempo de rir; tempo de prantear e tempo de saltar; 5 tempo de espalhar pedras e tempo de ajuntar pedras; tempo de abraçar e tempo de afastar-se de abraçar; 6 tempo de buscar e tempo de perder; tempo de guardar e tempo de deitar fora; 7 tempo de rasgar e tempo de coser; tempo de estar calado e tempo de falar; 8 tempo de amar e tempo de aborrecer; tempo de guerra e tempo de paz.

9 Que vantagem tem o trabalhador naquilo em que trabalha? 10 Tenho visto o trabalho que Deus deu aos filhos dos homens, para com ele os afligir. 11 Tudo fez formoso em seu tempo; também pôs o mundo no coração deles, sem que o homem possa descobrir a obra que Deus fez desde o princípio até ao fim. 12 Já tenho conhecido que não há coisa melhor para eles do que se alegrarem e fazerem bem na sua vida; 13 e também que todo homem coma e beba e goze do bem de todo o seu trabalho. Isso é um dom de Deus. 14 Eu sei que tudo quanto Deus faz durará eternamente; nada se lhe deve acrescentar e nada se lhe deve tirar. E isso faz Deus para que haja temor diante dele. 15 O que é já foi; e o que há de ser também já foi; e Deus pede conta do que passou.

16 Vi mais debaixo do sol: no lugar do juízo, impiedade; e no lugar da justiça, impiedade ainda. 17 Eu disse no meu coração: Deus julgará o justo e o ímpio; porque há um tempo para todo intento e para toda obra. 18 Disse eu no meu coração: é por causa dos filhos dos homens, para que Deus possa prová-los, e eles possam ver que são em si mesmos como os animais. 19 Porque o que sucede aos filhos dos homens, isso mesmo também sucede aos animais; a mesma coisa lhes sucede: como morre um, assim morre o outro, todos têm o mesmo fôlego; e a vantagem dos homens sobre os animais não é nenhuma, porque todos são vaidade. 20 Todos vão para um lugar; todos são pó e todos ao pó tornarão. 21 Quem adverte que o fôlego dos filhos dos homens sobe para cima e que o fôlego dos animais desce para baixo da terra? 22 Assim que tenho visto que não há coisa melhor do que alegrar-se o homem nas suas obras, porque essa é a sua porção; porque quem o fará voltar para ver o que será depois dele?Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.DEUS PAI VIVO ALTÍSSIMO FIEL O TODO PODEROSO SUPREMO CRIADOR IMORTAL SANTO que está ACIMA DE TUDO E SOBRE TODOS nós, disse DEUS VIVO que haja batalha no céu:Miguel e os seus anjos batalhavam contra o dragão; e batalhavam o dragão e os seus anjos, 8  não prevaleceram; nem mais o seu lugar se achou nos céus. 9 E foi precipitado o grande dragão, a antiga serpente, chamada o diabo e Satanás, que engana todo o mundo; ele foi precipitado na terra, e os seus anjos foram lançados com ele. 10 E ouvi uma grande voz no céuA qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele nos carrega em seus braços.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.GLORIFICADO DEUS PAI VIVO ALTÍSSIMO FIEL O TODO PODEROSO ESTÁ ACIMA DE TODOS,E SOBRE TUDO,E SOBRE TODOS NÓS.

"Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador, tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor; louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador! A cada dia ele nos carrega em seus braços.1 No princípio criou Deus os céus e a terra.
2 E a terra era sem forma e vazia; e havia trevas sobre a face do abismo; e o Espírito de Deus se movia sobre a face das águas.
3 E disse Deus: Haja luz; e houve luz.
4 E viu Deus que era boa a luz; e fez Deus separação entre a luz e as trevas.
5 E Deus chamou à luz Dia; e às trevas chamou Noite. E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia primeiro.
6 E disse Deus: Haja uma expansão no meio das águas, e haja separação entre águas e águas.
7 E fez Deus a expansão, e fez separação entre as águas que estavam debaixo da expansão e as águas que estavam sobre a expansão; e assim foi.
8 E chamou Deus à expansão Céus, e foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia segundo.
9 E disse Deus: Ajuntem-se as águas debaixo dos céus num lugar; e apareça a porção seca; e assim foi.
10 E chamou Deus à porção seca Terra; e ao ajuntamento das águas chamou Mares; e viu Deus que era bom.
11 E disse Deus: Produza a terra erva verde, erva que dê semente, árvore frutífera que dê fruto segundo a sua espécie, cuja semente está nela sobre a terra; e assim foi.
12 E a terra produziu erva, erva dando semente conforme a sua espécie, e a árvore frutífera, cuja semente está nela conforme a sua espécie; e viu Deus que era bom.
13 E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia terceiro.
14 E disse Deus: Haja luminares na expansão dos céus, para haver separação entre o dia e a noite; e sejam eles para sinais e para tempos determinados e para dias e anos.
15 E sejam para luminares na expansão dos céus, para iluminar a terra; e assim foi.
16 E fez Deus os dois grandes luminares: o luminar maior para governar o dia, e o luminar menor para governar a noite; e fez as estrelas.
17 E Deus os pôs na expansão dos céus para iluminar a terra,
18 E para governar o dia e a noite, e para fazer separação entre a luz e as trevas; e viu Deus que era bom.
19 E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia quarto.
20 E disse Deus: Produzam as águas abundantemente répteis de alma vivente; e voem as aves sobre a face da expansão dos céus.
21 E Deus criou as grandes baleias, e todo o réptil de alma vivente que as águas abundantemente produziram conforme as suas espécies; e toda a ave de asas conforme a sua espécie; e viu Deus que era bom.
22 E Deus os abençoou, dizendo: Frutificai e multiplicai-vos, e enchei as águas nos mares; e as aves se multipliquem na terra.
23 E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia quinto.
24 E disse Deus: Produza a terra alma vivente conforme a sua espécie; gado, e répteis e feras da terra conforme a sua espécie; e assim foi.
25 E fez Deus as feras da terra conforme a sua espécie, e o gado conforme a sua espécie, e todo o réptil da terra conforme a sua espécie; e viu Deus que era bom.
26 E disse Deus: Façamos o homem à nossa imagem, conforme a nossa semelhança; e domine sobre os peixes do mar, e sobre as aves dos céus, e sobre o gado, e sobre toda a terra, e sobre todo o réptil que se move sobre a terra.
27 E criou Deus o homem à sua imagem; à imagem de Deus o criou; homem e mulher os criou.
28 E Deus os abençoou, e Deus lhes disse: Frutificai e multiplicai-vos, e enchei a terra, e sujeitai-a; e dominai sobre os peixes do mar e sobre as aves dos céus, e sobre todo o animal que se move sobre a terra.
29 E disse Deus: Eis que vos tenho dado toda a erva que dê semente, que está sobre a face de toda a terra; e toda a árvore, em que há fruto que dê semente, ser-vos-á para mantimento.
30 E a todo o animal da terra, e a toda a ave dos céus, e a todo o réptil da terra, em que há alma vivente, toda a erva verde será para mantimento; e assim foi.
31 E viu Deus tudo quanto tinha feito, e eis que era muito bom; e foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia sexto.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.",soberano senhor meu deus meu salvador tu proteges cabe dia combate louvado seja senhor louvado

"1 No princípio criou Deus os céus e a terra.
2 E a terra era sem forma e vazia; e havia trevas sobre a face do abismo; e o Espírito de Deus se movia sobre a face das águas.
3 E disse Deus: Haja luz; e houve luz.
4 E viu Deus que era boa a luz; e fez Deus separação entre a luz e as trevas.
5 E Deus chamou à luz Dia; e às trevas chamou Noite. E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia primeiro.
6 E disse Deus: Haja uma expansão no meio das águas, e haja separação entre águas e águas.
7 E fez Deus a expansão, e fez separação entre as águas que estavam debaixo da expansão e as águas que estavam sobre a expansão; e assim foi.
8 E chamou Deus à expansão Céus, e foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia segundo.
9 E disse Deus: Ajuntem-se as águas debaixo dos céus num lugar; e apareça a porção seca; e assim foi.
10 E chamou Deus à porção seca Terra; e ao ajuntamento das águas chamou Mares; e viu Deus que era bom.
11 E disse Deus: Produza a terra erva verde, erva que dê semente, árvore frutífera que dê fruto segundo a sua espécie, cuja semente está nela sobre a terra; e assim foi.
12 E a terra produziu erva, erva dando semente conforme a sua espécie, e a árvore frutífera, cuja semente está nela conforme a sua espécie; e viu Deus que era bom.
13 E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia terceiro.
14 E disse Deus: Haja luminares na expansão dos céus, para haver separação entre o dia e a noite; e sejam eles para sinais e para tempos determinados e para dias e anos.
15 E sejam para luminares na expansão dos céus, para iluminar a terra; e assim foi.
16 E fez Deus os dois grandes luminares: o luminar maior para governar o dia, e o luminar menor para governar a noite; e fez as estrelas.
17 E Deus os pôs na expansão dos céus para iluminar a terra,
18 E para governar o dia e a noite, e para fazer separação entre a luz e as trevas; e viu Deus que era bom.
19 E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia quarto.
20 E disse Deus: Produzam as águas abundantemente répteis de alma vivente; e voem as aves sobre a face da expansão dos céus.
21 E Deus criou as grandes baleias, e todo o réptil de alma vivente que as águas abundantemente produziram conforme as suas espécies; e toda a ave de asas conforme a sua espécie; e viu Deus que era bom.
22 E Deus os abençoou, dizendo: Frutificai e multiplicai-vos, e enchei as águas nos mares; e as aves se multipliquem na terra.
23 E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia quinto.
24 E disse Deus: Produza a terra alma vivente conforme a sua espécie; gado, e répteis e feras da terra conforme a sua espécie; e assim foi.
25 E fez Deus as feras da terra conforme a sua espécie, e o gado conforme a sua espécie, e todo o réptil da terra conforme a sua espécie; e viu Deus que era bom.
26 E disse Deus: Façamos o homem à nossa imagem, conforme a nossa semelhança; e domine sobre os peixes do mar, e sobre as aves dos céus, e sobre o gado, e sobre toda a terra, e sobre todo o réptil que se move sobre a terra.
27 E criou Deus o homem à sua imagem; à imagem de Deus o criou; homem e mulher os criou.
28 E Deus os abençoou, e Deus lhes disse: Frutificai e multiplicai-vos, e enchei a terra, e sujeitai-a; e dominai sobre os peixes do mar e sobre as aves dos céus, e sobre todo o animal que se move sobre a terra.
29 E disse Deus: Eis que vos tenho dado toda a erva que dê semente, que está sobre a face de toda a terra; e toda a árvore, em que há fruto que dê semente, ser-vos-á para mantimento.
30 E a todo o animal da terra, e a toda a ave dos céus, e a todo o réptil da terra, em que há alma vivente, toda a erva verde será para mantimento; e assim foi.
31 E viu Deus tudo quanto tinha feito, e eis que era muito bom; e foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia sexto.Pai nosso, que estás nos céus!
Santificado seja o teu nome.
10Venha o teu Reino;
seja feita a tua vontade,
assim na terra como no céu.
11Dá-nos hoje o nosso
pão de cada dia.
12Perdoa as nossas dívidas,
assim como perdoamos
aos nossos devedores.
13E não nos deixes cair
em tentação,
mas livra-nos do mal,
porque teu é o Reino, o poder e a glória para sempre. Amém.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele nos carrega em seus braços.Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente.

"Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Jesus respondeu: Eu sou o caminho, a verdade e a vida; ninguém vem ao Pai senão por mim.Inclina, SENHOR, os teus ouvidos, e ouve-me, porque estou necessitado e aflito. 2 Guarda a minha alma, pois sou santo: ó Deus meu, salva o teu servo, que em ti confia. 3 Tem misericórdia de mim, ó Senhor, pois a ti clamo todo o dia. 4 Alegra a alma do teu servo, pois a ti, Senhor, levanto a minha alma. 5 Pois tu, Senhor, és bom, e pronto a perdoar, e abundante em benignidade para todos os que te invocam. 6 Dá ouvidos, SENHOR, à minha oração e atende à voz das minhas súplicas. 7 No dia da minha angústia clamo a ti, porquanto me respondes. 8 Entre os deuses não há semelhante a ti, Senhor, nem há obras como as tuas. 9 Todas as nações que fizeste virão e se prostrarão perante a tua face, Senhor, e glorificarão o teu nome. 10 Porque tu és grande e fazes maravilhas; só tu és Deus. 11 Ensina-me, SENHOR, o teu caminho, e andarei na tua verdade; une o meu coração ao temor do teu nome. 12 Louvar-te-ei, Senhor Deus meu, com todo o meu coração, e glorificarei o teu nome para sempre. 13 Pois grande é a tua misericórdia para comigo; e livraste a minha alma do inferno mais profunda. 14 O Deus, os soberbos se levantaram contra mim, e as assembléias dos tiranos procuraram a minha alma, e não te puseram perante os seus olhos. 15 Porém tu, Senhor, és um Deus cheio de compaixão, e piedoso, sofredor, e grande em benignidade e em verdade. 16 Volta-te para mim, e tem misericórdia de mim; dá a tua fortaleza ao teu servo, e salva ao filho da tua serva. 17 Mostra-me um sinal para bem, para que o vejam aqueles que me odeiam, e se confundam; porque tu, SENHOR, me ajudaste e me consolaste. "" - Salmos 8626 Mas aquele Consolador, o Espírito Santo, que o Pai enviará em meu nome, esse vos ensinará todas as coisas, e vos fará lembrar de tudo quanto vos tenho dito.Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente. Amém.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele nos carrega em seus braços.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.

21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.

24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.

"Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente. Amém.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele nos carrega em seus braços.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Para sempre, ó SENHOR, a tua palavra permanece no céu.
90	A tua fidelidade dura de geração em geração; tu firmaste a terra, e ela permanece firme.
91	Eles continuam até ao dia de hoje, segundo as tuas ordenações; porque todos são teus servos.
92	Se a tua lei não fora toda a minha recreação, há muito que pereceria na minha aflição.
93	Nunca me esquecerei dos teus preceitos; pois por eles me tens vivificado.
94	Sou teu, salva-me; pois tenho buscado os teus preceitos.
95	Os ímpios me esperam para me destruírem, mas eu considerarei os teus testemunhos.
96	Tenho visto fim a toda a perfeição, mas o teu mandamento é amplíssimo.
97	Mem. Oh! quanto amo a tua lei! É a minha meditação em todo o dia.
98	Tu, pelos teus mandamentos, me fazes mais sábio do que os meus inimigos; pois estão sempre comigo.
99	Tenho mais entendimento do que todos os meus mestres, porque os teus testemunhos são a minha meditação.
100	Entendo mais do que os antigos; porque guardo os teus preceitos.
101	Desviei os meus pés de todo caminho mau, para guardar a tua palavra.

25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém

"Ora, a fé é o firme fundamento das coisas que se esperam, e a prova das coisas que não se veem.
2 Porque por ela os antigos alcançaram testemunho.
3 Pela fé entendemos que os mundos pela palavra de Deus foram criados; de maneira que aquilo que se vê não foi feito do que é aparente.
4 Pela fé Abel ofereceu a Deus maior sacrifício do que Caim, pelo qual alcançou testemunho de que era justo, dando Deus testemunho dos seus dons, e por ela, depois de morto, ainda fala.
5 Pela fé Enoque foi trasladado para não ver a morte, e não foi achado, porque Deus o trasladara; visto como antes da sua trasladação alcançou testemunho de que agradara a Deus.
6 Ora, sem fé é impossível agradar-lhe; porque é necessário que aquele que se aproxima de Deus creia que ele existe, e que é galardoador dos que o buscam.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.22 Com homem não te deitarás, como se fosse mulher; abominação é;
23 Nem te deitarás com um animal, para te contaminares com ele; nem a mulher se porá perante um animal, para ajuntar-se com ele; confusão é.
24 Com nenhuma destas coisas vos contamineis; porque com todas estas coisas se contaminaram as nações que eu expulso de diante de vós.
25 Por isso a terra está contaminada; e eu visito a sua iniquidade, e a terra vomita os seus moradores.
26 Porém vós guardareis os meus estatutos e os meus juízos, e nenhuma destas abominações fareis, nem o natural, nem o estrangeiro que peregrina entre vós

"A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele nos carrega em seus braços.Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente. Amém.Ora, a fé é o firme fundamento das coisas que se esperam, e a prova das coisas que não se veem.
2 Porque por ela os antigos alcançaram testemunho.
3 Pela fé entendemos que os mundos pela palavra de Deus foram criados; de maneira que aquilo que se vê não foi feito do que é aparente.
4 Pela fé Abel ofereceu a Deus maior sacrifício do que Caim, pelo qual alcançou testemunho de que era justo, dando Deus testemunho dos seus dons, e por ela, depois de morto, ainda fala.
5 Pela fé Enoque foi trasladado para não ver a morte, e não foi achado, porque Deus o trasladara; visto como antes da sua trasladação alcançou testemunho de que agradara a Deus.
6 Ora, sem fé é impossível agradar-lhe; porque é necessário que aquele que se aproxima de Deus creia que ele existe, e que é galardoador dos que o buscam.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.A PAZ DO DEUS PAI VIVO PARA SEMPRE, ALTÍSSIMO FIEL O TODO PODEROSO,SANTO,JUSTO,JUIZ, SUPREMO,DONO DE TODAS AS COISAS E DOS CÉUS.FELICIDADE,FIDELIDADE INCALCULÁVEL,INFALÍVEL, INSONDÁVEL,INABALÁVEL, INQUEBRÁVEL,ROCHEDO FORTE, ESCUDO DA FÉ,BENIGNO,PIEDOSO, DIGNO GRANDE E INESCRUTÁVEL, INCOMPARÁVEL,VERDADEIRO, BRAÇOS FORTE,BENEVOLÊNTE, IMBATÍVEL,DESTEMIVEL FIEL JUSTO, MAJESTOSO,MARAVILHOSO, INVISÍVEL E MAIS DO QUE REAL, ONISCIENTE,ONIPRESENTE, ONIPOTENTE, DEUS VIVO ALTÍSSIMO É BOM O TEMPO TODO.GLORIFICADO DEUS PAI VIVO ALTÍSSIMO FIEL O TODO PODEROSO ESTÁ ACIMA DE TODOS,E SOBRE TUDO,E SOBRE TODOS NÓS.

17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Salmos 84
1Quão amáveis são os teus tabernáculos, SENHOR dos Exércitos!
2	A minha alma está desejosa, e desfalece pelos átrios do SENHOR; o meu coração e a minha carne clamam pelo Deus vivo.
3	Até o pardal encontrou casa, e a andorinha ninho para si, onde ponha seus filhos, até mesmo nos teus altares, SENHOR dos Exércitos, Rei meu e Deus meu.
4	Bem-aventurados os que habitam em tua casa; louvar-te-ão continuamente. (Selá.)
5	Bem-aventurado o homem cuja força está em ti, em cujo coração estão os caminhos aplanados.
6	Que, passando pelo vale de Baca, faz dele uma fonte; a chuva também enche os tanques.
7	Vão indo de força em força; cada um deles em Sião aparece perante Deus.
8	SENHOR Deus dos Exércitos, escuta a minha oração; inclina os ouvidos, ó Deus de Jacó! (Selá.)
9	Olha, ó Deus, escudo nosso, e contempla o rosto do teu ungido.
10	Porque vale mais um dia nos teus átrios do que mil. Preferiria estar à porta da casa do meu Deus, a habitar nas tendas dos ímpios.
11	Porque o SENHOR Deus é um sol e escudo; o SENHOR dará graça e glória; não retirará bem algum aos que andam na retidão.
12	SENHOR dos Exércitos, bem-aventurado o homem que em ti põe a sua confiança.Pai nosso, que estás nos céus!
Santificado seja o teu nome.
10Venha o teu Reino;
seja feita a tua vontade,
assim na terra como no céu.
11Dá-nos hoje o nosso
pão de cada dia.
12Perdoa as nossas dívidas,
assim como perdoamos
aos nossos devedores.
13E não nos deixes cair
em tentação,
mas livra-nos do mal,
porque teu é o Reino, o poder e a glória para sempre.

2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.

"Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele nos carrega em seus braços.Ora, a fé é o firme fundamento das coisas que se esperam, e a prova das coisas que não se veem.
2 Porque por ela os antigos alcançaram testemunho.
3 Pela fé entendemos que os mundos pela palavra de Deus foram criados; de maneira que aquilo que se vê não foi feito do que é aparente.
4 Pela fé Abel ofereceu a Deus maior sacrifício do que Caim, pelo qual alcançou testemunho de que era justo, dando Deus testemunho dos seus dons, e por ela, depois de morto, ainda fala.
5 Pela fé Enoque foi trasladado para não ver a morte, e não foi achado, porque Deus o trasladara; visto como antes da sua trasladação alcançou testemunho de que agradara a Deus.
6 Ora, sem fé é impossível agradar-lhe; porque é necessário que aquele que se aproxima de Deus creia que ele existe, e que é galardoador dos que o buscam.Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente. Amém.Inclina, SENHOR, os teus ouvidos, e ouve-me, porque estou necessitado e aflito. 2 Guarda a minha alma, pois sou santo: ó Deus meu, salva o teu servo, que em ti confia. 3 Tem misericórdia de mim, ó Senhor, pois a ti clamo todo o dia. 4 Alegra a alma do teu servo, pois a ti, Senhor, levanto a minha alma. 5 Pois tu, Senhor, és bom, e pronto a perdoar, e abundante em benignidade para todos os que te invocam. 6 Dá ouvidos, SENHOR, à minha oração e atende à voz das minhas súplicas. 7 No dia da minha angústia clamo a ti, porquanto me respondes. 8 Entre os deuses não há semelhante a ti, Senhor, nem há obras como as tuas. 9 Todas as nações que fizeste virão e se prostrarão perante a tua face, Senhor, e glorificarão o teu nome. 10 Porque tu és grande e fazes maravilhas; só tu és Deus. 11 Ensina-me, SENHOR, o teu caminho, e andarei na tua verdade; une o meu coração ao temor do teu nome. 12 Louvar-te-ei, Senhor Deus meu, com todo o meu coração, e glorificarei o teu nome para sempre. 13 Pois grande é a tua misericórdia para comigo; e livraste a minha alma do inferno mais profunda. 14 O Deus, os soberbos se levantaram contra mim, e as assembléias dos tiranos procuraram a minha alma, e não te puseram perante os seus olhos. 15 Porém tu, Senhor, és um Deus cheio de compaixão, e piedoso, sofredor, e grande em benignidade e em verdade. 16 Volta-te para mim, e tem misericórdia de mim; dá a tua fortaleza ao teu servo, e salva ao filho da tua serva. 17 Mostra-me um sinal para bem, para que o vejam aqueles que me odeiam, e se confundam; porque tu, SENHOR, me ajudaste e me consolaste.

2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,

13E não nos deixes cair
em tentação,
mas livra-nos do mal,
porque teu é o Reino, o poder e a glória para sempre. Amém.1 No princípio criou Deus os céus e a terra.
2 E a terra era sem forma e vazia; e havia trevas sobre a face do abismo; e o Espírito de Deus se movia sobre a face das águas.
3 E disse Deus: Haja luz; e houve luz.
4 E viu Deus que era boa a luz; e fez Deus separação entre a luz e as trevas.
5 E Deus chamou à luz Dia; e às trevas chamou Noite. E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia primeiro.
6 E disse Deus: Haja uma expansão no meio das águas, e haja separação entre águas e águas.
7 E fez Deus a expansão, e fez separação entre as águas que estavam debaixo da expansão e as águas que estavam sobre a expansão; e assim foi.
8 E chamou Deus à expansão Céus, e foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia segundo.
9 E disse Deus: Ajuntem-se as águas debaixo dos céus num lugar; e apareça a porção seca; e assim foi.
10 E chamou Deus à porção seca Terra; e ao ajuntamento das águas chamou Mares; e viu Deus que era bom.
11 E disse Deus: Produza a terra erva verde, erva que dê semente, árvore frutífera que dê fruto segundo a sua espécie, cuja semente está nela sobre a terra; e assim foi.
12 E a terra produziu erva, erva dando semente conforme a sua espécie, e a árvore frutífera, cuja semente está nela conforme a sua espécie; e viu Deus que era bom.
13 E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia terceiro.
14 E disse Deus: Haja luminares na expansão dos céus, para haver separação entre o dia e a noite; e sejam eles para sinais e para tempos determinados e para dias e anos.
15 E sejam para luminares na expansão dos céus, para iluminar a terra; e assim foi.
16 E fez Deus os dois grandes luminares: o luminar maior para governar o dia, e o luminar menor para governar a noite; e fez as estrelas.
17 E Deus os pôs na expansão dos céus para iluminar a terra,
18 E para governar o dia e a noite, e para fazer separação entre a luz e as trevas; e viu Deus que era bom.
19 E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia quarto.
20 E disse Deus: Produzam as águas abundantemente répteis de alma vivente; e voem as aves sobre a face da expansão dos céus.
21 E Deus criou as grandes baleias, e todo o réptil de alma vivente que as águas abundantemente produziram conforme as suas espécies; e toda a ave de asas conforme a sua espécie; e viu Deus que era bom.
22 E Deus os abençoou, dizendo: Frutificai e multiplicai-vos, e enchei as águas nos mares; e as aves se multipliquem na terra.
23 E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia quinto.
24 E disse Deus: Produza a terra alma vivente conforme a sua espécie; gado, e répteis e feras da terra conforme a sua espécie; e assim foi.
25 E fez Deus as feras da terra conforme a sua espécie, e o gado conforme a sua espécie, e todo o réptil da terra conforme a sua espécie; e viu Deus que era bom.
26 E disse Deus: Façamos o homem à nossa imagem, conforme a nossa semelhança; e domine sobre os peixes do mar, e sobre as aves dos céus, e sobre o gado, e sobre toda a terra, e sobre todo o réptil que se move sobre a terra.
27 E criou Deus o homem à sua imagem; à imagem de Deus o criou; homem e mulher os criou.
28 E Deus os abençoou, e Deus lhes disse: Frutificai e multiplicai-vos, e enchei a terra, e sujeitai-a; e dominai sobre os peixes do mar e sobre as aves dos céus, e sobre todo o animal que se move sobre a terra.
29 E disse Deus: Eis que vos tenho dado toda a erva que dê semente, que está sobre a face de toda a terra; e toda a árvore, em que há fruto que dê semente, ser-vos-á para mantimento.
30 E a todo o animal da terra, e a toda a ave dos céus, e a todo o réptil da terra, em que há alma vivente, toda a erva verde será para mantimento; e assim foi.
31 E viu Deus tudo quanto tinha feito, e eis que era muito bom; e foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia sexto.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.",paz deus pai vivo para sempre alt ssimo fiel todo poderoso santo justo juiz supremo dono de

Swing my heart across the line
And in my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye shall find

Old but I'm not that old
Young but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold

"DEUS PAI VIVO ALTÍSSIMO FIEL O TODO PODEROSO SUPREMO CRIADOR IMORTAL SANTO que está ACIMA DE TUDO E SOBRE TODOS nós, disse DEUS VIVO que haja batalha no céu:Miguel e os seus anjos batalhavam contra o dragão; e batalhavam o dragão e os seus anjos, 8  não prevaleceram; nem mais o seu lugar se achou nos céus. 9 E foi precipitado o grande dragão, a antiga serpente, chamada o diabo e Satanás, que engana todo o mundo; ele foi precipitado na terra, e os seus anjos foram lançados com ele. 10 E ouvi uma grande voz no céuA qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele nos carrega em seus braços.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.

2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.

Apocalipse 7
1	E depois destas coisas vi quatro anjos que estavam sobre os quatro cantos da terra, retendo os quatro ventos da terra, para que nenhum vento soprasse sobre a terra, nem sobre o mar, nem contra árvore alguma.
2	E vi outro anjo subir do lado do sol nascente, e que tinha o selo do Deus vivo; e clamou com grande voz aos quatro anjos, a quem fora dado o poder de danificar a terra e o mar,
3	Dizendo: Não danifiqueis a terra, nem o mar, nem as árvores, até que hajamos assinalado nas suas testas os servos do nosso Deus.
4	E ouvi o número dos assinalados, e eram cento e quarenta e quatro mil assinalados, de todas as tribos dos filhos de Israel.
5	Da tribo de Judá, havia doze mil assinalados; da tribo de Rúben, doze mil assinalados; da tribo de Gade, doze mil assinalados;
6	Da tribo de Aser, doze mil assinalados; da tribo de Naftali, doze mil assinalados; da tribo de Manassés, doze mil assinalados;
7	Da tribo de Simeão, doze mil assinalados; da tribo de Levi, doze mil assinalados; da tribo de Issacar, doze mil assinalados;
8	Da tribo de Zebulom, doze mil assinalados; da tribo de José, doze mil assinalados; da tribo de Benjamim, doze mil assinalados.
9	Depois destas coisas olhei, e eis aqui uma multidão, a qual ninguém podia contar, de todas as nações, e tribos, e povos, e línguas, que estavam diante do trono, e perante o Cordeiro, trajando vestes brancas e com palmas nas suas mãos;
10	E clamavam com grande voz, dizendo: Salvação ao nosso Deus, que está assentado no trono, e ao Cordeiro.
11	E todos os anjos estavam ao redor do trono, e dos anciãos, e dos quatro animais; e prostraram-se diante do trono sobre seus rostos, e adoraram a Deus,
12	Dizendo: Amém. Louvor, e glória, e sabedoria, e ação de graças, e honra, e poder, e força ao nosso Deus, para todo o sempre. Amém.
13	E um dos anciãos me falou, dizendo: Estes que estão vestidos de vestes brancas, quem são, e de onde vieram?
14	E eu disse-lhe: Senhor, tu sabes. E ele disse-me: Estes são os que vieram da grande tribulação, e lavaram as suas vestes e as branquearam no sangue do Cordeiro.
15	Por isso estão diante do trono de Deus, e o servem de dia e de noite no seu templo; e aquele que está assentado sobre o trono os cobrirá com a sua sombra.
16	Nunca mais terão fome, nunca mais terão sede; nem sol nem calma alguma cairá sobre eles.
17	Porque o Cordeiro que está no meio do trono os apascentará, e lhes servirá de guia para as fontes das águas da vida; e Deus limpará de seus olhos toda a lágrima.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele nos carrega em seus braços.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.

Salmos 140
1	[Salmo de Davi para o músico-mor] Livra-me, ó SENHOR, do homem mau; guarda-me do homem violento,
2	Que pensa o mal no coração; continuamente se ajuntam para a guerra.
3	Aguçaram as línguas como a serpente; o veneno das víboras está debaixo dos seus lábios. (Selá.)
4	Guarda-me, ó SENHOR, das mãos do ímpio; guarda-me do homem violento; os quais se propuseram transtornar os meus passos.
5	Os soberbos armaram-me laços e cordas; estenderam a rede ao lado do caminho; armaram-me laços corrediços. (Selá.)
6	Eu disse ao SENHOR: Tu és o meu Deus; ouve a voz das minhas súplicas, ó SENHOR.
7	O DEUS o Senhor, fortaleza da minha salvação, tu cobriste a minha cabeça no dia da batalha.
8	Não concedas, ó SENHOR, ao ímpio os seus desejos; não promovas o seu mau propósito, para que não se exalte. (Selá.)
9	Quanto à cabeça dos que me cercam, cubra-os a maldade dos seus lábios.
10	Caiam sobre eles brasas vivas; sejam lançados no fogo, em covas profundas, para que se não tornem a levantar.
11	Não terá firmeza na terra o homem de má língua; o mal perseguirá o homem violento até que seja desterrado.
12	Sei que o SENHOR sustentará a causa do oprimido, e o direito do necessitado.
13	Assim os justos louvarão o teu nome; os retos habitarão na tua presença.



Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.",louvado seja senhor louvado seja deus nosso salvador cada dia ele nos carrega em seus bra os

"Ora, a fé é o firme fundamento das coisas que se esperam, e a prova das coisas que não se veem.
2 Porque por ela os antigos alcançaram testemunho.
3 Pela fé entendemos que os mundos pela palavra de Deus foram criados; de maneira que aquilo que se vê não foi feito do que é aparente.
4 Pela fé Abel ofereceu a Deus maior sacrifício do que Caim, pelo qual alcançou testemunho de que era justo, dando Deus testemunho dos seus dons, e por ela, depois de morto, ainda fala.
5 Pela fé Enoque foi trasladado para não ver a morte, e não foi achado, porque Deus o trasladara; visto como antes da sua trasladação alcançou testemunho de que agradara a Deus.
6 Ora, sem fé é impossível agradar-lhe; porque é necessário que aquele que se aproxima de Deus creia que ele existe, e que é galardoador dos que o buscam.Ó profundidade das riquezas, tanto da sabedoria, como do conhecimento de Deus! Quão insondáveis são os seus juízos, e quão inescrutáveis os seus caminhos!
34 Porque, quem compreendeu a mente do Senhor? Ou quem foi seu conselheiro?
35 Ou quem lhe deu primeiro a ele, para que lhe seja recompensado?
36 Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente. Amém.GRATIDÃO DEUS PAI VIVO ALTÍSSIMO FIEL O TODO PODEROSO,FIEL ,VITORIOSO,JUIZ E JUSTO, SOBERANO, MAGNÍFICO, MAJESTOSO, MARAVILHOSO,

2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.",ora firme fundamento das coisas que se esperam prova das coisas que se veem porque por ela os

Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal

a quem ninguém viu

O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele nos carrega em seus braços.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.

17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,

Diridiri, dirididi Daddy
Go!
Sí, sabes que ya llevo un rato mirándote
Tengo que bailar contigo hoy (DY)

Muéstrame el camino que yo voy
Oh, tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Solo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (oh yeah)

Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmar las paredes de tu laberinto

Mami, esto es dando y dándolo
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bam bam
Sabe que esa beba 'tá buscando de mi bam bam
Ven prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empezamo' lento, después salvaje
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito

Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas (oh no)
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza (slow, oh yeah)

"1 No princípio criou Deus os céus e a terra.
2 E a terra era sem forma e vazia; e havia trevas sobre a face do abismo; e o Espírito de Deus se movia sobre a face das águas.
3 E disse Deus: Haja luz; e houve luz.
4 E viu Deus que era boa a luz; e fez Deus separação entre a luz e as trevas.
5 E Deus chamou à luz Dia; e às trevas chamou Noite. E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia primeiro.
6 E disse Deus: Haja uma expansão no meio das águas, e haja separação entre águas e águas.
7 E fez Deus a expansão, e fez separação entre as águas que estavam debaixo da expansão e as águas que estavam sobre a expansão; e assim foi.
8 E chamou Deus à expansão Céus, e foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia segundo.
9 E disse Deus: Ajuntem-se as águas debaixo dos céus num lugar; e apareça a porção seca; e assim foi.
10 E chamou Deus à porção seca Terra; e ao ajuntamento das águas chamou Mares; e viu Deus que era bom.
11 E disse Deus: Produza a terra erva verde, erva que dê semente, árvore frutífera que dê fruto segundo a sua espécie, cuja semente está nela sobre a terra; e assim foi.
12 E a terra produziu erva, erva dando semente conforme a sua espécie, e a árvore frutífera, cuja semente está nela conforme a sua espécie; e viu Deus que era bom.
13 E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia terceiro.
14 E disse Deus: Haja luminares na expansão dos céus, para haver separação entre o dia e a noite; e sejam eles para sinais e para tempos determinados e para dias e anos.
15 E sejam para luminares na expansão dos céus, para iluminar a terra; e assim foi.
16 E fez Deus os dois grandes luminares: o luminar maior para governar o dia, e o luminar menor para governar a noite; e fez as estrelas.
17 E Deus os pôs na expansão dos céus para iluminar a terra,
18 E para governar o dia e a noite, e para fazer separação entre a luz e as trevas; e viu Deus que era bom.
19 E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia quarto.
20 E disse Deus: Produzam as águas abundantemente répteis de alma vivente; e voem as aves sobre a face da expansão dos céus.
21 E Deus criou as grandes baleias, e todo o réptil de alma vivente que as águas abundantemente produziram conforme as suas espécies; e toda a ave de asas conforme a sua espécie; e viu Deus que era bom.
22 E Deus os abençoou, dizendo: Frutificai e multiplicai-vos, e enchei as águas nos mares; e as aves se multipliquem na terra.
23 E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia quinto.
24 E disse Deus: Produza a terra alma vivente conforme a sua espécie; gado, e répteis e feras da terra conforme a sua espécie; e assim foi.
25 E fez Deus as feras da terra conforme a sua espécie, e o gado conforme a sua espécie, e todo o réptil da terra conforme a sua espécie; e viu Deus que era bom.
26 E disse Deus: Façamos o homem à nossa imagem, conforme a nossa semelhança; e domine sobre os peixes do mar, e sobre as aves dos céus, e sobre o gado, e sobre toda a terra, e sobre todo o réptil que se move sobre a terra.
27 E criou Deus o homem à sua imagem; à imagem de Deus o criou; homem e mulher os criou.
28 E Deus os abençoou, e Deus lhes disse: Frutificai e multiplicai-vos, e enchei a terra, e sujeitai-a; e dominai sobre os peixes do mar e sobre as aves dos céus, e sobre todo o animal que se move sobre a terra.
29 E disse Deus: Eis que vos tenho dado toda a erva que dê semente, que está sobre a face de toda a terra; e toda a árvore, em que há fruto que dê semente, ser-vos-á para mantimento.
30 E a todo o animal da terra, e a toda a ave dos céus, e a todo o réptil da terra, em que há alma vivente, toda a erva verde será para mantimento; e assim foi.
31 E viu Deus tudo quanto tinha feito, e eis que era muito bom; e foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia sexto.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente.

"Salmos 119
1 Bem-aventurados os retos em seus caminhos, que andam na lei do SENHOR.
2	Bem-aventurados os que guardam os seus testemunhos, e que o buscam com todo o coração.
3	E não praticam iniqüidade, mas andam nos seus caminhos.
4	Tu ordenaste os teus mandamentos, para que diligentemente os observássemos.
5	Quem dera que os meus caminhos fossem dirigidos a observar os teus mandamentos.
6	Então não ficaria confundido, atentando eu para todos os teus mandamentos.
7	Louvar-te-ei com retidão de coração quando tiver aprendido os teus justos juízos.
8	Observarei os teus estatutos; não me desampares totalmente.
9	Bet. Com que purificará o jovem o seu caminho? Observando-o conforme a tua palavra.
10	Com todo o meu coração te busquei; não me deixes desviar dos teus mandamentos.
11	Escondi a tua palavra no meu coração, para eu não pecar contra ti.
12	Bendito és tu, ó SENHOR; ensina-me os teus estatutos.
13	Com os meus lábios declarei todos os juízos da tua boca.
14	Folguei tanto no caminho dos teus testemunhos, como em todas as riquezas.
15	Meditarei nos teus preceitos, e terei respeito aos teus caminhos.
16	Recrear-me-ei nos teus estatutos; não me esquecerei da tua palavra.
17	Guímel. Faze bem ao teu servo, para que viva e observe a tua palavra.
18	Abre tu os meus olhos, para que veja as maravilhas da tua lei.
19	Sou peregrino na terra; não escondas de mim os teus mandamentos.
20	A minha alma está quebrantada de desejar os teus juízos em todo o tempo.
21	Tu repreendeste asperamente os soberbos que são amaldiçoados, que se desviam dos teus mandamentos.
22	Tira de sobre mim o opróbrio e o desprezo, pois guardei os teus testemunhos.
23	Príncipes também se assentaram, e falaram contra mim, mas o teu servo meditou nos teus estatutos.
24	Também os teus testemunhos são o meu prazer e os meus conselheiros.
25	Dálet. A minha alma está pegada ao pó; vivifica-me segundo a tua palavra.
26	Eu te contei os meus caminhos, e tu me ouviste; ensina-me os teus estatutos.
27	Faze-me entender o caminho dos teus preceitos; assim falarei das tuas maravilhas.
28	A minha alma consome-se de tristeza; fortalece-me segundo a tua palavra.
29	Desvia de mim o caminho da falsidade, e concede-me piedosamente a tua lei.
30	Escolhi o caminho da verdade; propus-me seguir os teus juízos.
31	Apego-me aos teus testemunhos; ó SENHOR, não me confundas.
32	Correrei pelo caminho dos teus mandamentos, quando dilatares o meu coração.
33	He. Ensina-me, ó SENHOR, o caminho dos teus estatutos, e guardá-lo-ei até o fim.
34	Dá-me entendimento, e guardarei a tua lei, e observá-la-ei de todo o meu coração.
35	Faze-me andar na vereda dos teus mandamentos, porque nela tenho prazer.
36	Inclina o meu coração aos teus testemunhos, e não à cobiça.
37	Desvia os meus olhos de contemplarem a vaidade, e vivifica-me no teu caminho.
38	Confirma a tua palavra ao teu servo, que é dedicado ao teu temor.
39	Desvia de mim o opróbrio que temo, pois os teus juízos são bons.
40	Eis que tenho desejado os teus preceitos; vivifica-me na tua justiça.
41	Vav. Venham sobre mim também as tuas misericórdias, ó SENHOR, e a tua salvação segundo a tua palavra.
42	Assim terei que responder ao que me afronta, pois confio na tua palavra.
43	E não tires totalmente a palavra de verdade da minha boca, pois tenho esperado nos teus juízos.
44	Assim observarei de continuo a tua lei para sempre e eternamente.
45	E andarei em liberdade; pois busco os teus preceitos.
46	Também falarei dos teus testemunhos perante os reis, e não me envergonharei.
47	E recrear-me-ei em teus mandamentos, que tenho amado.
48	Também levantarei as minhas mãos para os teus mandamentos, que amei, e meditarei nos teus estatutos.
49	Záin. Lembra-te da palavra dada ao teu servo, na qual me fizeste esperar.
50	Isto é a minha consolação na minha aflição, porque a tua palavra me vivificou.
51	Os soberbos zombaram grandemente de mim; contudo não me desviei da tua lei.
52	Lembrei-me dos teus juízos antiqüíssimos, ó SENHOR, e assim me consolei.
53	Grande indignação se apoderou de mim por causa dos ímpios que abandonam a tua lei.
54	Os teus estatutos têm sido os meus cânticos na casa da minha peregrinação.
55	Lembrei-me do teu nome, ó SENHOR, de noite, e observei a tua lei.
56	Isto fiz eu, porque guardei os teus mandamentos.
57	Het. O SENHOR é a minha porção; eu disse que observaria as tuas palavras.
58	Roguei deveras o teu favor com todo o meu coração; tem piedade de mim, segundo a tua palavra.
59	Considerei os meus caminhos, e voltei os meus pés para os teus testemunhos.
60	Apressei-me, e não me detive, a observar os teus mandamentos.
61	Bandos de ímpios me despojaram, mas eu não me esqueci da tua lei.
62	Å meia noite me levantarei para te louvar, pelos teus justos juízos.
63	Companheiro sou de todos os que te temem e dos que guardam os teus preceitos.
64	A terra, ó SENHOR, está cheia da tua benignidade; ensina-me os teus estatutos.
65	Tet. Fizeste bem ao teu servo, SENHOR, segundo a tua palavra.
66	Ensina-me bom juízo e ciência, pois cri nos teus mandamentos.
67	Antes de ser afligido andava errado; mas agora tenho guardado a tua palavra.
68	Tu és bom e fazes bem; ensina-me os teus estatutos.
69	Os soberbos forjaram mentiras contra mim; mas eu com todo o meu coração guardarei os teus preceitos.
70	Engrossa-se-lhes o coração como gordura, mas eu me recreio na tua lei.
71	Foi-me bom ter sido afligido, para que aprendesse os teus estatutos.
72	Melhor é para mim a lei da tua boca do que milhares de ouro ou prata.
73	Iód. As tuas mãos me fizeram e me formaram; dá-me inteligência para entender os teus mandamentos.
74	Os que te temem alegraram-se quando me viram, porque tenho esperado na tua palavra.
75	Bem sei eu, ó SENHOR, que os teus juízos são justos, e que segundo a tua fidelidade me afligiste.
76	Sirva pois a tua benignidade para me consolar, segundo a palavra que deste ao teu servo.
77	Venham sobre mim as tuas misericórdias, para que viva, pois a tua lei é a minha delícia.
78	Confundam-se os soberbos, pois me trataram duma maneira perversa, sem causa; mas eu meditarei nos teus preceitos.
79	Voltem-se para mim os que te temem, e aqueles que têm conhecido os teus testemunhos.
80	Seja reto o meu coração nos teus estatutos, para que não seja confundido.
81	Cáf. Desfalece a minha alma pela tua salvação, mas espero na tua palavra.
82	Os meus olhos desfalecem pela tua palavra; entrementes dizia: Quando me consolarás tu?
83	Pois estou como odre na fumaça; contudo não me esqueço dos teus estatutos.
84	Quantos serão os dias do teu servo? Quando me farás justiça contra os que me perseguem?
85	Os soberbos me cavaram covas, o que não é conforme a tua lei.
86	Todos os teus mandamentos são verdade. Com mentiras me perseguem; ajuda-me.
87	Quase que me têm consumido sobre a terra, mas eu não deixei os teus preceitos.
88	Vivifica-me segundo a tua benignidade; assim guardarei o testemunho da tua boca.
89	Lámed. Para sempre, ó SENHOR, a tua palavra permanece no céu.
90	A tua fidelidade dura de geração em geração; tu firmaste a terra, e ela permanece firme.
91	Eles continuam até ao dia de hoje, segundo as tuas ordenações; porque todos são teus servos.
92	Se a tua lei não fora toda a minha recreação, há muito que pereceria na minha aflição.
93	Nunca me esquecerei dos teus preceitos; pois por eles me tens vivificado.
94	Sou teu, salva-me; pois tenho buscado os teus preceitos.
95	Os ímpios me esperam para me destruírem, mas eu considerarei os teus testemunhos.
96	Tenho visto fim a toda a perfeição, mas o teu mandamento é amplíssimo.
97	Mem. Oh! quanto amo a tua lei! É a minha meditação em todo o dia.
98	Tu, pelos teus mandamentos, me fazes mais sábio do que os meus inimigos; pois estão sempre comigo.
99	Tenho mais entendimento do que todos os meus mestres, porque os teus testemunhos são a minha meditação.
100	Entendo mais do que os antigos; porque guardo os teus preceitos.
101	Desviei os meus pés de todo caminho mau, para guardar a tua palavra.
102	Não me apartei dos teus juízos, pois tu me ensinaste.
103	Oh! quão doces são as tuas palavras ao meu paladar, mais doces do que o mel à minha boca.
104	Pelos teus mandamentos alcancei entendimento; por isso odeio todo falso caminho.
105	Nun. Lâmpada para os meus pés é tua palavra, e luz para o meu caminho.
106	Jurei, e o cumprirei, que guardarei os teus justos juízos.
107	Estou aflitíssimo; vivifica-me, ó SENHOR, segundo a tua palavra.
108	Aceita, eu te rogo, as oferendas voluntárias da minha boca, ó SENHOR; ensina-me os teus juízos.
109	A minha alma está de contínuo nas minhas mãos; todavia não me esqueço da tua lei.
110	Os ímpios me armaram laço; contudo não me desviei dos teus preceitos.
111	Os teus testemunhos tenho eu tomado por herança para sempre, pois são o gozo do meu coração.
112	Inclinei o meu coração a guardar os teus estatutos, para sempre, até ao fim.
113	Sámech. Odeio os pensamentos vãos, mas amo a tua lei.
114	Tu és o meu refúgio e o meu escudo; espero na tua palavra.
115	Apartai-vos de mim, malfeitores, pois guardarei os mandamentos do meu Deus.
116	Sustenta-me conforme a tua palavra, para que viva, e não me deixes envergonhado da minha esperança.
117	Sustenta-me, e serei salvo, e de contínuo terei respeito aos teus estatutos.
118	Tu tens pisado aos pés todos os que se desviam dos teus estatutos, pois o engano deles é falsidade.
119	Tu tiraste da terra todos os ímpios, como a escória, por isso amo os teus testemunhos.
120	O meu corpo se arrepiou com temor de ti, e temi os teus juízos.
121	Aín. Fiz juízo e justiça; não me entregues aos meus opressores.

"Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente. Amém.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém

"Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente. Amém.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém

"Pai nosso, que estás nos céus!
Santificado seja o teu nome.
10Venha o teu Reino;
seja feita a tua vontade,
assim na terra como no céu.
11Dá-nos hoje o nosso
pão de cada dia.
12Perdoa as nossas dívidas,
assim como perdoamos
aos nossos devedores.
13E não nos deixes cair
em tentação,
mas livra-nos do mal,
porque teu é o Reino, o poder e a glória para sempre. Amém.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele nos carrega em seus braços.Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente.

10Venha o teu Reino;
seja feita a tua vontade,
assim na terra como no céu.
11Dá-nos hoje o nosso
pão de cada dia.
12Perdoa as nossas dívidas,
assim como perdoamos
aos nossos devedores.
13E não nos deixes cair
em tentação,
mas livra-nos do mal,
porque teu é o Reino, o poder e a glória para sempre. Amém.1 Não se turbe o vosso coração; credes em Deus, crede também em mim.
2 Na casa de meu Pai há muitas moradas; se não fosse assim, eu vo-lo teria dito. Vou preparar-vos lugar.
3 E quando eu for, e vos preparar lugar, virei outra vez, e vos levarei para mim mesmo, para que onde eu estiver estejais vós também.
4 Mesmo vós sabeis para onde vou, e conheceis o caminho.
5 Disse-lhe Tomé: Senhor, nós não sabemos para onde vais; e como podemos saber o caminho?
6 Disse-lhe Jesus: Eu sou o caminho, e a verdade e a vida; ninguém vem ao Pai, senão por mim.
7 Se vós me conhecêsseis a mim, também conheceríeis a meu Pai; e já desde agora o conheceis, e o tendes visto.
8 Disse-lhe Filipe: Senhor, mostra-nos o Pai, o que nos basta.
9 Disse-lhe Jesus: Estou há tanto tempo convosco, e não me tendes conhecido, Filipe? Quem me vê a mim vê o Pai; e como dizes tu: Mostra-nos o Pai?
10 Não crês tu que eu estou no Pai, e que o Pai está em mim? As palavras que eu vos digo não as digo de mim mesmo, mas o Pai, que está em mim, é quem faz as obras.
11 Crede-me que estou no Pai, e o Pai em mim; crede-me, ao menos, por causa das mesmas obras.
12 Na verdade, na verdade vos digo que aquele que crê em mim também fará as obras que eu faço, e as fará maiores do que estas, porque eu vou para meu Pai.
13 E tudo quanto pedirdes em meu nome eu o farei, para que o Pai seja glorificado no Filho.
14 Se pedirdes alguma coisa em meu nome, eu o farei.
15 Se me amais, guardai os meus mandamentos.
16 E eu rogarei ao Pai, e ele vos dará outro Consolador, para que fique convosco para sempre;
17 O Espírito de verdade, que o mundo não pode receber, porque não o vê nem o conhece; mas vós o conheceis, porque habita convosco, e estará em vós.
18 Não vos deixarei órfãos; voltarei para vós.
19 Ainda um pouco, e o mundo não me verá mais, mas vós me vereis; porque eu vivo, e vós vivereis.
20 Naquele dia conhecereis que estou em meu Pai, e vós em mim, e eu em vós.
21 Aquele que tem os meus mandamentos e os guarda esse é o que me ama; e aquele que me ama será amado de meu Pai, e eu o amarei, e me manifestarei a ele.
22 Disse-lhe Judas (não o Iscariotes): Senhor, de onde vem que te hás de manifestar a nós, e não ao mundo?
23 Jesus respondeu, e disse-lhe: Se alguém me ama, guardará a minha palavra, e meu Pai o amará, e viremos para ele, e faremos nele morada.
24 Quem não me ama não guarda as minhas palavras; ora, a palavra que ouvistes não é minha, mas do Pai que me enviou.
25 Tenho-vos dito isto, estando convosco.
26 Mas aquele Consolador, o Espírito Santo, que o Pai enviará em meu nome, esse vos ensinará todas as coisas, e vos fará lembrar de tudo quanto vos tenho dito.
27 Deixo-vos a paz, a minha paz vos dou; não vo-la dou como o mundo a dá. Não se turbe o vosso coração, nem se atemorize.
28 Ouvistes que eu vos disse: Vou, e venho para vós. Se me amásseis, certamente exultaríeis porque eu disse: Vou para o Pai; porque meu Pai é maior do que eu.
29 Eu vo-lo disse agora antes que aconteça, para que, quando acontecer, vós acrediteis.
30 Já não falarei muito convosco, porque se aproxima o príncipe deste mundo, e nada tem em mim;
31 Mas é para que o mundo saiba que eu amo o Pai, e que faço como o Pai me mandou. Levantai-vos, vamo-nos daqui.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.

12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.

Salmos 140
1	[Salmo de Davi para o músico-mor] Livra-me, ó SENHOR, do homem mau; guarda-me do homem violento,
2	Que pensa o mal no coração; continuamente se ajuntam para a guerra.
3	Aguçaram as línguas como a serpente; o veneno das víboras está debaixo dos seus lábios. (Selá.)
4	Guarda-me, ó SENHOR, das mãos do ímpio; guarda-me do homem violento; os quais se propuseram transtornar os meus passos.
5	Os soberbos armaram-me laços e cordas; estenderam a rede ao lado do caminho; armaram-me laços corrediços. (Selá.)
6	Eu disse ao SENHOR: Tu és o meu Deus; ouve a voz das minhas súplicas, ó SENHOR.
7	O DEUS o Senhor, fortaleza da minha salvação, tu cobriste a minha cabeça no dia da batalha.
8	Não concedas, ó SENHOR, ao ímpio os seus desejos; não promovas o seu mau propósito, para que não se exalte. (Selá.)
9	Quanto à cabeça dos que me cercam, cubra-os a maldade dos seus lábios.
10	Caiam sobre eles brasas vivas; sejam lançados no fogo, em covas profundas, para que se não tornem a levantar.
11	Não terá firmeza na terra o homem de má língua; o mal perseguirá o homem violento até que seja desterrado.
12	Sei que o SENHOR sustentará a causa do oprimido, e o direito do necessitado.
13	Assim os justos louvarão o teu nome; os retos habitarão na tua presença.



Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre.

2 Na casa de meu Pai há muitas moradas; se não fosse assim, eu vo-lo teria dito. Vou preparar-vos lugar.
3 E quando eu for, e vos preparar lugar, virei outra vez, e vos levarei para mim mesmo, para que onde eu estiver estejais vós também.
4 Mesmo vós sabeis para onde vou, e conheceis o caminho.
5 Disse-lhe Tomé: Senhor, nós não sabemos para onde vais; e como podemos saber o caminho?
6 Disse-lhe Jesus: Eu sou o caminho, e a verdade e a vida; ninguém vem ao Pai, senão por mim.
7 Se vós me conhecêsseis a mim, também conheceríeis a meu Pai; e já desde agora o conheceis, e o tendes visto.
8 Disse-lhe Filipe: Senhor, mostra-nos o Pai, o que nos basta.
9 Disse-lhe Jesus: Estou há tanto tempo convosco, e não me tendes conhecido, Filipe? Quem me vê a mim vê o Pai; e como dizes tu: Mostra-nos o Pai?
10 Não crês tu que eu estou no Pai, e que o Pai está em mim? As palavras que eu vos digo não as digo de mim mesmo, mas o Pai, que está em mim, é quem faz as obras.
11 Crede-me que estou no Pai, e o Pai em mim; crede-me, ao menos, por causa das mesmas obras.
12 Na verdade, na verdade vos digo que aquele que crê em mim também fará as obras que eu faço, e as fará maiores do que estas, porque eu vou para meu Pai.
13 E tudo quanto pedirdes em meu nome eu o farei, para que o Pai seja glorificado no Filho.
14 Se pedirdes alguma coisa em meu nome, eu o farei.
15 Se me amais, guardai os meus mandamentos.
16 E eu rogarei ao Pai, e ele vos dará outro Consolador, para que fique convosco para sempre;
17 O Espírito de verdade, que o mundo não pode receber, porque não o vê nem o conhece; mas vós o conheceis, porque habita convosco, e estará em vós.
18 Não vos deixarei órfãos; voltarei para vós.
19 Ainda um pouco, e o mundo não me verá mais, mas vós me vereis; porque eu vivo, e vós vivereis.
20 Naquele dia conhecereis que estou em meu Pai, e vós em mim, e eu em vós.
21 Aquele que tem os meus mandamentos e os guarda esse é o que me ama; e aquele que me ama será amado de meu Pai, e eu o amarei, e me manifestarei a ele.
22 Disse-lhe Judas (não o Iscariotes): Senhor, de onde vem que te hás de manifestar a nós, e não ao mundo?
23 Jesus respondeu, e disse-lhe: Se alguém me ama, guardará a minha palavra, e meu Pai o amará, e viremos para ele, e faremos nele morada.
24 Quem não me ama não guarda as minhas palavras; ora, a palavra que ouvistes não é minha, mas do Pai que me enviou.
25 Tenho-vos dito isto, estando convosco.
26 Mas aquele Consolador, o Espírito Santo, que o Pai enviará em meu nome, esse vos ensinará todas as coisas, e vos fará lembrar de tudo quanto vos tenho dito.
27 Deixo-vos a paz, a minha paz vos dou; não vo-la dou como o mundo a dá. Não se turbe o vosso coração, nem se atemorize.
28 Ouvistes que eu vos disse: Vou, e venho para vós. Se me amásseis, certamente exultaríeis porque eu disse: Vou para o Pai; porque meu Pai é maior do que eu.
29 Eu vo-lo disse agora antes que aconteça, para que, quando acontecer, vós acrediteis.
30 Já não falarei muito convosco, porque se aproxima o príncipe deste mundo, e nada tem em mim;
31 Mas é para que o mundo saiba que eu amo o Pai, e que faço como o Pai me mandou. Levantai-vos, vamo-nos daqui.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele nos carrega em seus braços.Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente.

10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém

what hit 'em Got that warm fuzzy feeling Yeah them chills Used to get 'em Now you're getting fucking sick Of looking at 'em You swore you've never hit 'em Never do nothing to hurt 'em Now you're in each other's face Spewing venom In Your words When you spit 'em You push Pull each other's hair Scratch, claw, bit 'em Throw 'em down Pin 'em So lost in the moments When you're in 'em It's the rage

broken records Playing' over But you promised her Next time you'll show restraint You don't get another chance Life is no Nintendo game But you lied again Now you get to watch her leave Out the window

I love the way you lie I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie Now I know we said things Did things That we didn't mean And we fall back Into the same patterns Same routine But your temper's just as bad As mine is You're the same as me But when it comes to love You're just as blinded Baby please come back It wasn't you Baby it was me Maybe our relationship Isn't as crazy as it seems Maybe that's what happens When a tornado meets a volcano All I know is I love you too much To walk the though Come inside Pick up your bags off the sidewalk Don't you hear sincerity In my voice when I talk

"Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele nos carrega em seus braços.Inclina, SENHOR, os teus ouvidos, e ouve-me, porque estou necessitado e aflito. 2 Guarda a minha alma, pois sou santo: ó Deus meu, salva o teu servo, que em ti confia. 3 Tem misericórdia de mim, ó Senhor, pois a ti clamo todo o dia. 4 Alegra a alma do teu servo, pois a ti, Senhor, levanto a minha alma. 5 Pois tu, Senhor, és bom, e pronto a perdoar, e abundante em benignidade para todos os que te invocam. 6 Dá ouvidos, SENHOR, à minha oração e atende à voz das minhas súplicas. 7 No dia da minha angústia clamo a ti, porquanto me respondes. 8 Entre os deuses não há semelhante a ti, Senhor, nem há obras como as tuas. 9 Todas as nações que fizeste virão e se prostrarão perante a tua face, Senhor, e glorificarão o teu nome. 10 Porque tu és grande e fazes maravilhas; só tu és Deus. 11 Ensina-me, SENHOR, o teu caminho, e andarei na tua verdade; une o meu coração ao temor do teu nome. 12 Louvar-te-ei, Senhor Deus meu, com todo o meu coração, e glorificarei o teu nome para sempre. 13 Pois grande é a tua misericórdia para comigo; e livraste a minha alma do inferno mais profunda. 14 O Deus, os soberbos se levantaram contra mim, e as assembléias dos tiranos procuraram a minha alma, e não te puseram perante os seus olhos. 15 Porém tu, Senhor, és um Deus cheio de compaixão, e piedoso, sofredor, e grande em benignidade e em verdade. 16 Volta-te para mim, e tem misericórdia de mim; dá a tua fortaleza ao teu servo, e salva ao filho da tua serva. 17 Mostra-me um sinal para bem, para que o vejam aqueles que me odeiam, e se confundam; porque tu, SENHOR, me ajudaste e me consolaste. "" - Salmos 86Ora, a fé é o firme fundamento das coisas que se esperam, e a prova das coisas que não se veem.
2 Porque por ela os antigos alcançaram testemunho.
3 Pela fé entendemos que os mundos pela palavra de Deus foram criados; de maneira que aquilo que se vê não foi feito do que é aparente.
4 Pela fé Abel ofereceu a Deus maior sacrifício do que Caim, pelo qual alcançou testemunho de que era justo, dando Deus testemunho dos seus dons, e por ela, depois de morto, ainda fala.
5 Pela fé Enoque foi trasladado para não ver a morte, e não foi achado, porque Deus o trasladara; visto como antes da sua trasladação alcançou testemunho de que agradara a Deus.
6 Ora, sem fé é impossível agradar-lhe; porque é necessário que aquele que se aproxima de Deus creia que ele existe, e que é galardoador dos que o buscam.Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente. Amém.",senhor mas ao teu nome gl ria por amor da tua benignidade da tua verdade por que dir os gentios onde est seu deus mas nosso deus est nos us fez tudo que lhe agradou os dolos deles prata ouro

"Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele nos carrega em seus braços.Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente. Amém.Pai nosso, que estás nos céus!
Santificado seja o teu nome.
10Venha o teu Reino;
seja feita a tua vontade,
assim na terra como no céu.
11Dá-nos hoje o nosso
pão de cada dia.
12Perdoa as nossas dívidas,
assim como perdoamos
aos nossos devedores.
13E não nos deixes cair
em tentação,

"16	Porque não me envergonho do evangelho de Cristo, pois é o poder de Deus para salvação de todo aquele que crê; primeiro do judeu, e também do grego.
17	Porque nele se descobre a justiça de Deus de fé em fé, como está escrito: Mas o justo viverá da fé.
18	Porque do céu se manifesta a ira de Deus sobre toda a impiedade e injustiça dos homens, que detêm a verdade em injustiça.
19	Porquanto o que de Deus se pode conhecer neles se manifesta, porque Deus lho manifestou.
20	Porque as suas coisas invisíveis, desde a criação do mundo, tanto o seu eterno poder, como a sua divindade, se entendem, e claramente se vêem pelas coisas que estão criadas, para que eles fiquem inescusáveis;
21	Porquanto, tendo conhecido a Deus, não o glorificaram como Deus, nem lhe deram graças, antes em seus discursos se desvaneceram, e o seu coração insensato se obscureceu.
22	Dizendo-se sábios, tornaram-se loucos.
23	E mudaram a glória do Deus incorruptível em semelhança da imagem de homem corruptível, e de aves, e de quadrúpedes, e de répteis.
24	Por isso também Deus os entregou às concupiscências de seus corações, à imundícia, para desonrarem seus corpos entre si;
25	Pois mudaram a verdade de Deus em mentira, e honraram e serviram mais a criatura do que o Criador, que é bendito eternamente. Amém.
26	Por isso Deus os abandonou às paixões infames. Porque até as suas mulheres mudaram o uso natural, no contrário à natureza.
27	E, semelhantemente, também os homens, deixando o uso natural da mulher, se inflamaram em sua sensualidade uns para com os outros, homens com homens, cometendo torpeza e recebendo em si mesmos a recompensa que convinha ao seu erro.
28	E, como eles não se importaram de ter conhecimento de Deus, assim Deus os entregou a um sentimento perverso, para fazerem coisas que não convêm;
29	Estando cheios de toda a iniqüidade, prostituição, malícia, avareza, maldade; cheios de inveja, homicídio, contenda, engano, malignidade;
30	Sendo murmuradores, detratores, aborrecedores de Deus, injuriadores, soberbos, presunçosos, inventores de males, desobedientes aos pais e às mães;
31	Néscios, infiéis nos contratos, sem afeição natural, irreconciliáveis, sem misericórdia;
32	Os quais, conhecendo a justiça de Deus (que são dignos de morte os que tais coisas praticam), não somente as fazem, mas também consentem aos que as fazem.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente. Amém.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,

2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.

"Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente. Amém.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele nos carrega em seus braços.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.

"Salmos 140
1	[Salmo de Davi para o músico-mor] Livra-me, ó SENHOR, do homem mau; guarda-me do homem violento,
2	Que pensa o mal no coração; continuamente se ajuntam para a guerra.
3	Aguçaram as línguas como a serpente; o veneno das víboras está debaixo dos seus lábios. (Selá.)
4	Guarda-me, ó SENHOR, das mãos do ímpio; guarda-me do homem violento; os quais se propuseram transtornar os meus passos.
5	Os soberbos armaram-me laços e cordas; estenderam a rede ao lado do caminho; armaram-me laços corrediços. (Selá.)
6	Eu disse ao SENHOR: Tu és o meu Deus; ouve a voz das minhas súplicas, ó SENHOR.
7	O DEUS o Senhor, fortaleza da minha salvação, tu cobriste a minha cabeça no dia da batalha.
8	Não concedas, ó SENHOR, ao ímpio os seus desejos; não promovas o seu mau propósito, para que não se exalte. (Selá.)
9	Quanto à cabeça dos que me cercam, cubra-os a maldade dos seus lábios.
10	Caiam sobre eles brasas vivas; sejam lançados no fogo, em covas profundas, para que se não tornem a levantar.
11	Não terá firmeza na terra o homem de má língua; o mal perseguirá o homem violento até que seja desterrado.
12	Sei que o SENHOR sustentará a causa do oprimido, e o direito do necessitado.
13	Assim os justos louvarão o teu nome; os retos habitarão na tua presença.

A cada dia ele nos carrega em seus braços.Vocês não sabem que os perversos não herdarão o Reino de Deus? Não se deixem enganar: nem imorais, nem idólatras, nem adúlteros, nem homossexuais passivos ou ativos,
10 nem ladrões, nem avarentos, nem alcoólatras, nem caluniadores, nem trapaceiros herdarão o Reino de Deus.
11 Assim foram alguns de vocês. Mas vocês foram lavados, foram santificados, foram justificados no nome do Senhor Jesus Cristo e no Espírito de nosso Deus.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.

2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele nos carrega em seus braços.GLORIFICADO DEUS PAI VIVO ALTÍSSIMO FIEL O TODO PODEROSO ESTÁ ACIMA DE TODOS,E SOBRE TUDO,E SOBRE TODOS NÓS.

"DEUS PAI VIVO ALTÍSSIMO FIEL O TODO PODEROSO QUE ESTA ACIMA DE TUDO E SOBRE TODOS disse:Tudo tem o seu tempo determinado, e há tempo para todo o propósito debaixo do céu: 2 há tempo de nascer e tempo de morrer; tempo de plantar e tempo de arrancar o que se plantou; 3 tempo de matar e tempo de curar; tempo de derribar e tempo de edificar; 4 tempo de chorar e tempo de rir; tempo de prantear e tempo de saltar; 5 tempo de espalhar pedras e tempo de ajuntar pedras; tempo de abraçar e tempo de afastar-se de abraçar; 6 tempo de buscar e tempo de perder; tempo de guardar e tempo de deitar fora; 7 tempo de rasgar e tempo de coser; tempo de estar calado e tempo de falar; 8 tempo de amar e tempo de aborrecer; tempo de guerra e tempo de paz.

9 Que vantagem tem o trabalhador naquilo em que trabalha? 10 Tenho visto o trabalho que Deus deu aos filhos dos homens, para com ele os afligir. 11 Tudo fez formoso em seu tempo; também pôs o mundo no coração deles, sem que o homem possa descobrir a obra que Deus fez desde o princípio até ao fim. 12 Já tenho conhecido que não há coisa melhor para eles do que se alegrarem e fazerem bem na sua vida; 13 e também que todo homem coma e beba e goze do bem de todo o seu trabalho. Isso é um dom de Deus. 14 Eu sei que tudo quanto Deus faz durará eternamente; nada se lhe deve acrescentar e nada se lhe deve tirar. E isso faz Deus para que haja temor diante dele. 15 O que é já foi; e o que há de ser também já foi; e Deus pede conta do que passou.

16 Vi mais debaixo do sol: no lugar do juízo, impiedade; e no lugar da justiça, impiedade ainda. 17 Eu disse no meu coração: Deus julgará o justo e o ímpio; porque há um tempo para todo intento e para toda obra. 18 Disse eu no meu coração: é por causa dos filhos dos homens, para que Deus possa prová-los, e eles possam ver que são em si mesmos como os animais. 19 Porque o que sucede aos filhos dos homens, isso mesmo também sucede aos animais; a mesma coisa lhes sucede: como morre um, assim morre o outro, todos têm o mesmo fôlego; e a vantagem dos homens sobre os animais não é nenhuma, porque todos são vaidade. 20 Todos vão para um lugar; todos são pó e todos ao pó tornarão. 21 Quem adverte que o fôlego dos filhos dos homens sobe para cima e que o fôlego dos animais desce para baixo da terra? 22 Assim que tenho visto que não há coisa melhor do que alegrar-se o homem nas suas obras, porque essa é a sua porção; porque quem o fará voltar para ver o que será depois dele?DEUS PAI VIVO ALTÍSSIMO FIEL O TODO PODEROSO SUPREMO CRIADOR IMORTAL SANTO que está ACIMA DE TUDO E SOBRE TODOS nós, disse DEUS VIVO que haja batalha no céu:Miguel e os seus anjos batalhavam contra o dragão; e batalhavam o dragão e os seus anjos, 8  não prevaleceram; nem mais o seu lugar se achou nos céus. 9 E foi precipitado o grande dragão, a antiga serpente, chamada o diabo e Satanás, que engana todo o mundo; ele foi precipitado na terra, e os seus anjos foram lançados com ele. 10 E ouvi uma grande voz no céuA qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele nos carrega em seus braços.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Pai nosso, que estás nos céus!
Santificado seja o teu nome.
10Venha o teu Reino;
seja feita a tua vontade,
assim na terra como no céu.
11Dá-nos hoje o nosso
pão de cada dia.
12Perdoa as nossas dívidas,
assim como perdoamos
aos nossos devedores.
13E não nos deixes cair
em tentação,
mas livra-nos do mal,
porque teu é o Reino, o poder e a glória para sempre. Amém.GLORIFICADO DEUS PAI VIVO ALTÍSSIMO FIEL O TODO PODEROSO ESTÁ ACIMA DE TODOS,E SOBRE TUDO,E SOBRE TODOS NÓS.

"Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente. Amém.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.

"1 No princípio criou Deus os céus e a terra.
2 E a terra era sem forma e vazia; e havia trevas sobre a face do abismo; e o Espírito de Deus se movia sobre a face das águas.
3 E disse Deus: Haja luz; e houve luz.
4 E viu Deus que era boa a luz; e fez Deus separação entre a luz e as trevas.
5 E Deus chamou à luz Dia; e às trevas chamou Noite. E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia primeiro.
6 E disse Deus: Haja uma expansão no meio das águas, e haja separação entre águas e águas.
7 E fez Deus a expansão, e fez separação entre as águas que estavam debaixo da expansão e as águas que estavam sobre a expansão; e assim foi.
8 E chamou Deus à expansão Céus, e foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia segundo.
9 E disse Deus: Ajuntem-se as águas debaixo dos céus num lugar; e apareça a porção seca; e assim foi.
10 E chamou Deus à porção seca Terra; e ao ajuntamento das águas chamou Mares; e viu Deus que era bom.
11 E disse Deus: Produza a terra erva verde, erva que dê semente, árvore frutífera que dê fruto segundo a sua espécie, cuja semente está nela sobre a terra; e assim foi.
12 E a terra produziu erva, erva dando semente conforme a sua espécie, e a árvore frutífera, cuja semente está nela conforme a sua espécie; e viu Deus que era bom.
13 E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia terceiro.
14 E disse Deus: Haja luminares na expansão dos céus, para haver separação entre o dia e a noite; e sejam eles para sinais e para tempos determinados e para dias e anos.
15 E sejam para luminares na expansão dos céus, para iluminar a terra; e assim foi.
16 E fez Deus os dois grandes luminares: o luminar maior para governar o dia, e o luminar menor para governar a noite; e fez as estrelas.
17 E Deus os pôs na expansão dos céus para iluminar a terra,
18 E para governar o dia e a noite, e para fazer separação entre a luz e as trevas; e viu Deus que era bom.
19 E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia quarto.
20 E disse Deus: Produzam as águas abundantemente répteis de alma vivente; e voem as aves sobre a face da expansão dos céus.
21 E Deus criou as grandes baleias, e todo o réptil de alma vivente que as águas abundantemente produziram conforme as suas espécies; e toda a ave de asas conforme a sua espécie; e viu Deus que era bom.
22 E Deus os abençoou, dizendo: Frutificai e multiplicai-vos, e enchei as águas nos mares; e as aves se multipliquem na terra.
23 E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia quinto.
24 E disse Deus: Produza a terra alma vivente conforme a sua espécie; gado, e répteis e feras da terra conforme a sua espécie; e assim foi.
25 E fez Deus as feras da terra conforme a sua espécie, e o gado conforme a sua espécie, e todo o réptil da terra conforme a sua espécie; e viu Deus que era bom.
26 E disse Deus: Façamos o homem à nossa imagem, conforme a nossa semelhança; e domine sobre os peixes do mar, e sobre as aves dos céus, e sobre o gado, e sobre toda a terra, e sobre todo o réptil que se move sobre a terra.
27 E criou Deus o homem à sua imagem; à imagem de Deus o criou; homem e mulher os criou.
28 E Deus os abençoou, e Deus lhes disse: Frutificai e multiplicai-vos, e enchei a terra, e sujeitai-a; e dominai sobre os peixes do mar e sobre as aves dos céus, e sobre todo o animal que se move sobre a terra.
29 E disse Deus: Eis que vos tenho dado toda a erva que dê semente, que está sobre a face de toda a terra; e toda a árvore, em que há fruto que dê semente, ser-vos-á para mantimento.
30 E a todo o animal da terra, e a toda a ave dos céus, e a todo o réptil da terra, em que há alma vivente, toda a erva verde será para mantimento; e assim foi.
31 E viu Deus tudo quanto tinha feito, e eis que era muito bom; e foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia sexto.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente. Amém.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele

Love The Way You Lie (feat. Rihanna)
Eminem

















Me Encanta La Forma En Que Mientes (part. Rihanna)
Love The Way You Lie (feat. Rihanna)
¿Solo vas a quedarte ahí y verme arder?
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Bueno, está bien, porque me gusta la forma en que duele
Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
¿Solo vas a quedarte ahí y escucharme llorar?
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Bueno, está bien, porque me encanta la forma en que mientes
Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie
Me encanta la forma en que mientes
I love the way you lie

No puedo decirte lo que realmente es
I can't tell you what it really is
Solo puedo decirte como se siente
I can only tell you what it feels like
Y ahora mismo hay un cuchillo de acero en mi tráquea
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
No puedo respirar, pero sigo luchando mientras puedo luchar
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
Mientras lo malo se sienta bien, es como si estuviera en vuelo
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight

Drogado de su amor, borracho de su odio
High off her love, drunk from her hate
Es como si estuviera respirando pintura
It's like I'm huffing paint
Y la amo cuanto más sufro, me asfixio
And I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
Y justo antes de que me ahogue, ella me resucita
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
Ella me odia, y a mí me encanta, ¡espera!
She fucking hates me, and I love it, wait!

¿A dónde vas? Te estoy dejando
Where you going? I'm leaving you
No, no lo estás, vuelve
No you ain't, come back
Estamos corriendo de regreso, aquí vamos otra vez
We're running right back, here we go again
Es una locura, porque cuando va bien, va genial
It's so insane, 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
Soy Superman con el viento a sus espaldas, ella es Lois Lane
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane

Pero cuando es malo, es horrible, me siento tan avergonzado
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
Le espeté: ¿Quién es ese tipo? Ni siquiera sé su nombre
I snapped: Who's that dude? I don't even know his name
Le puse las manos encima, nunca volveré a rebajarme tanto
I laid hands on him, I'll never stoop so low again
Creo que no conozco mi propia fuerza
I guess I don't know my own strength

¿Solo vas a quedarte ahí y verme arder?
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Bueno, está bien, porque me gusta la forma en que duele
Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
¿Solo vas a quedarte ahí y escucharme llorar?
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Bueno, está bien, porque me encanta la forma en que mientes
Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie
Me encanta la forma en que mientes, me encanta la forma en que mientes

"Para sempre, ó SENHOR, a tua palavra permanece no céu.

91	Eles continuam até ao dia de hoje, segundo as tuas ordenações; porque todos são teus servos.
92	Se a tua lei não fora toda a minha recreação, há muito que pereceria na minha aflição.
93	Nunca me esquecerei dos teus preceitos; pois por eles me tens vivificado.
94	Sou teu, salva-me; pois tenho buscado os teus preceitos.
95	Os ímpios me esperam para me destruírem, mas eu considerarei os teus testemunhos.
96	Tenho visto fim a toda a perfeição, mas o teu mandamento é amplíssimo.
97	Mem. Oh! quanto amo a tua lei! É a minha meditação em todo o dia.
98	Tu, pelos teus mandamentos, me fazes mais sábio do que os meus inimigos; pois estão sempre comigo.
99	Tenho mais entendimento do que todos os meus mestres, porque os teus testemunhos são a minha meditação.

2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.

Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele nos carrega em seus braços.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.

17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.",paz deus pai vivo para sempre alt ssimo fiel todo poderoso santo justo juiz supremo dono de

"Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente. Amém.Inclina, SENHOR, os teus ouvidos, e ouve-me, porque estou necessitado e aflito. 2 Guarda a minha alma, pois sou santo: ó Deus meu, salva o teu servo, que em ti confia. 3 Tem misericórdia de mim, ó Senhor, pois a ti clamo todo o dia. 4 Alegra a alma do teu servo, pois a ti, Senhor, levanto a minha alma. 5 Pois tu, Senhor, és bom, e pronto a perdoar, e abundante em benignidade para todos os que te invocam. 6 Dá ouvidos, SENHOR, à minha oração e atende à voz das minhas súplicas. 7 No dia da minha angústia clamo a ti, porquanto me respondes. 8 Entre os deuses não há semelhante a ti, Senhor, nem há obras como as tuas. 9 Todas as nações que fizeste virão e se prostrarão perante a tua face, Senhor, e glorificarão o teu nome. 10 Porque tu és grande e fazes maravilhas; só tu és Deus. 11 Ensina-me, SENHOR, o teu caminho, e andarei na tua verdade; une o meu coração ao temor do teu nome. 12 Louvar-te-ei, Senhor Deus meu, com todo o meu coração, e glorificarei o teu nome para sempre. 13 Pois grande é a tua misericórdia para comigo; e livraste a minha alma do inferno mais profunda. 14 O Deus, os soberbos se levantaram contra mim, e as assembléias dos tiranos procuraram a minha alma, e não te puseram perante os seus olhos. 15 Porém tu, Senhor, és um Deus cheio de compaixão, e piedoso, sofredor, e grande em benignidade e em verdade. 16 Volta-te para mim, e tem misericórdia de mim; dá a tua fortaleza ao teu servo, e salva ao filho da tua serva. 17 Mostra-me um sinal para bem, para que o vejam aqueles que me odeiam, e se confundam; porque tu, SENHOR, me ajudaste e me consolaste. "" - Salmos 86Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.

3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele nos carrega em seus braços.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.",porque dele por ele para ele todas coisas gl ria pois ele eternamente inclina senhor os teus

"DEUS PAI VIVO ALTÍSSIMO FIEL O TODO PODEROSO SUPREMO CRIADOR IMORTAL SANTO que está ACIMA DE TUDO E SOBRE TODOS nós, disse DEUS VIVO que haja batalha no céu:Miguel e os seus anjos batalhavam contra o dragão; e batalhavam o dragão e os seus anjos, 8  não prevaleceram; nem mais o seu lugar se achou nos céus. 9 E foi precipitado o grande dragão, a antiga serpente, chamada o diabo e Satanás, que engana todo o mundo; ele foi precipitado na terra, e os seus anjos foram lançados com ele. 10 E ouvi uma grande voz no céuA qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele nos carrega em seus braços.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.

7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.

11Dá-nos hoje o nosso

12Perdoa as nossas dívidas,
assim como perdoamos
aos nossos devedores.
13E não nos deixes cair
em tentação,
mas livra-nos do mal,
porque teu é o Reino, o poder e a glória para sempre. Amém.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?

10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente. Amém.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele nos carrega em seus braços.GLORIFICADO DEUS PAI VIVO ALTÍSSIMO FIEL O TODO PODEROSO ESTÁ ACIMA DE TODOS,E SOBRE TUDO,E SOBRE TODOS NÓS.

2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente. Amém.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,

"Então falou Deus todas estas palavras, dizendo:
2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente. Amém.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele nos carrega em seus braços.Louvado seja o Senhor; louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!

Salmos 140
1	[Salmo de Davi para o músico-mor] Livra-me, ó SENHOR, do homem mau; guarda-me do homem violento,
2	Que pensa o mal no coração; continuamente se ajuntam para a guerra.
3	Aguçaram as línguas como a serpente; o veneno das víboras está debaixo dos seus lábios. (Selá.)
4	Guarda-me, ó SENHOR, das mãos do ímpio; guarda-me do homem violento; os quais se propuseram transtornar os meus passos.
5	Os soberbos armaram-me laços e cordas; estenderam a rede ao lado do caminho; armaram-me laços corrediços. (Selá.)
6	Eu disse ao SENHOR: Tu és o meu Deus; ouve a voz das minhas súplicas, ó SENHOR.
7	O DEUS o Senhor, fortaleza da minha salvação, tu cobriste a minha cabeça no dia da batalha.
8	Não concedas, ó SENHOR, ao ímpio os seus desejos; não promovas o seu mau propósito, para que não se exalte. (Selá.)
9	Quanto à cabeça dos que me cercam, cubra-os a maldade dos seus lábios.
10	Caiam sobre eles brasas vivas; sejam lançados no fogo, em covas profundas, para que se não tornem a levantar.
11	Não terá firmeza na terra o homem de má língua; o mal perseguirá o homem violento até que seja desterrado.
12	Sei que o SENHOR sustentará a causa do oprimido, e o direito do necessitado.
13	Assim os justos louvarão o teu nome; os retos habitarão na tua presença.",ent falou deus todas estas palavras dizendo eu sou senhor teu deus que te tirei da terra egito da casa da servid ter outros

"Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife
In my windpipe
I can't breathe
But I still fight
While I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right
It's like I'm in flight
High of a love
Drunk from the hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint
And I love it the more that I suffer
I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown
She resuscitates me
She fucking hates me
And I love it
Wait
Where you going
I'm leaving you
No you ain't
Come back
We're running right back
Here we go again
It's so insane
Cause when it's going good
It's going great
I'm Superman
With the wind at his back
She's Lois Lane
But when it's bad
It's awful
I feel so ashamed
I snap
Who's that dude
I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her
I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie

You ever love somebody so much
You can barely breathe
When you're with them
You meet
And neither one of you
Even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feeling
Yeah them chills
Used to get 'em
Now you're getting fucking sick
Of looking at 'em
You swore you've never hit 'em
Never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewing venom
In Your words
When you spit 'em
You push
Pull each other's hair
Scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down
Pin 'em
So lost in the moments
When you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over
It controls you both
So they say it's best
To go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
Cause today
That was yesterday
Yesterday is over
It's a different day
Sound like broken records
Playing' over
But you promised her
Next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance
Life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave
Out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie

Now I know we said things
Did things
That we didn't mean
And we fall back
Into the same patterns
Same routine
But your temper's just as bad
As mine is
You're the same as me
But when it comes to love
You're just as blinded
Baby please come back
It wasn't you
Baby it was me
Maybe our relationship
Isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens
When a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is
I love you too much
To walk away though
Come inside
Pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity
In my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault
Look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed
I'll aim my fist
At the dry wall
Next time
There will be no next time
I apologize
Even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games
I just want her back
I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again
I'mma tie her to the bed
And set this house on fire

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie

2 Eu sou o Senhor teu Deus, que te tirei da terra do Egito, da casa da servidão.
3 Não terás outros deuses diante de mim.
4 Não farás para ti imagem de escultura, nem alguma semelhança do que há em cima nos céus, nem embaixo na terra, nem nas águas debaixo da terra.
5 Não te encurvarás a elas nem as servirás; porque eu, o Senhor teu Deus, sou Deus zeloso, que visito a iniquidade dos pais nos filhos, até a terceira e quarta geração daqueles que me odeiam.
6 E faço misericórdia a milhares dos que me amam e aos que guardam os meus mandamentos.
7 Não tomarás o nome do Senhor teu Deus em vão; porque o Senhor não terá por inocente o que tomar o seu nome em vão.
8 Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar.
9 Seis dias trabalharás, e farás toda a tua obra.
10 Mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus; não farás nenhuma obra, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o teu estrangeiro, que está dentro das tuas portas.
11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor os céus e a terra, o mar e tudo que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; portanto abençoou o Senhor o dia do sábado, e o santificou.
12 Honra a teu pai e a tua mãe, para que se prolonguem os teus dias na terra que o Senhor teu Deus te dá.
13 Não matarás.
14 Não adulterarás.
15 Não furtarás.
16 Não dirás falso testemunho contra o teu próximo.
17 Não cobiçarás a casa do teu próximo, não cobiçarás a mulher do teu próximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu próximo.
18 E todo o povo viu os trovões e os relâmpagos, e o sonido da trombeta, e o monte fumegando; e o povo, vendo isso retirou-se e pôs-se de longe.
19 E disseram a Moisés: Fala tu conosco, e ouviremos: e não fale Deus conosco, para que não morramos.
20 E disse Moisés ao povo: Não temais, Deus veio para vos provar, e para que o seu temor esteja diante de vós, a fim de que não pequeis.
21 E o povo estava em pé de longe. Moisés, porém, se chegou à escuridão, onde Deus estava.
22 Então disse o Senhor a Moisés: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: Vós tendes visto que, dos céus, eu falei convosco.
23 Não fareis outros deuses comigo; deuses de prata ou deuses de ouro não fareis para vós.
24 Um altar de terra me farás, e sobre ele sacrificarás os teus holocaustos, e as tuas ofertas pacíficas, as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas; em todo o lugar, onde eu fizer celebrar a memória do meu nome, virei a ti e te abençoarei.
25 E se me fizeres um altar de pedras, não o farás de pedras lavradas; se sobre ele levantares o teu buril, profaná-lo-ás.
26 Também não subirás ao meu altar por degraus, para que a tua nudez não seja descoberta diante deles.Não a nós, Senhor, não a nós, mas ao teu nome dá glória, por amor da tua benignidade e da tua verdade.
2 Por que dirão os gentios: Onde está o seu Deus?
3 Mas o nosso Deus está nos céus; fez tudo o que lhe agradou.
4 Os ídolos deles são prata e ouro, obra das mãos dos homens.
5 Têm boca, mas não falam; olhos têm, mas não veem.
6 Têm ouvidos, mas não ouvem; narizes têm, mas não cheiram.
7 Têm mãos, mas não apalpam; pés têm, mas não andam; nem som algum sai da sua garganta.
8 A eles se tornem semelhantes os que os fazem, assim como todos os que neles confiam.
9 Israel, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
10 Casa de Arão, confia no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
11 Vós, os que temeis ao Senhor, confiai no Senhor; ele é o seu auxílio e o seu escudo.
12 O Senhor se lembrou de nós; ele nos abençoará; abençoará a casa de Israel; abençoará a casa de Arão.
13 Abençoará os que temem ao Senhor, tanto pequenos como grandes.
14 O Senhor vos aumentará cada vez mais, a vós e a vossos filhos.
15 Sois benditos do Senhor, que fez os céus e a terra.
16 Os céus são os céus do Senhor; mas a terra a deu aos filhos dos homens.
17 Os mortos não louvam ao Senhor, nem os que descem ao silêncio.
18 Mas nós bendiremos ao Senhor, desde agora e para sempre. Louvai ao Senhor.Porque dele e por ele, e para ele, são todas as coisas; glória, pois, a ele eternamente. Amém.A qual Deus fará se cumprir no devido tempo.
Ele é o bendito e único Soberano,
o Rei dos reis
e Senhor dos senhores,o único que é imortal
e habita em luz inacessível,
a quem ninguém viu
nem pode ver.
A ele sejam honra e poder para sempre.Amém
O Senhor estabeleceu o seu trono nos céus,
e como rei domina sobre tudo o que existe.Ó soberano SENHOR, meu Deus e meu Salvador,tu me proteges a cabeça no dia do combate.Louvado seja o Senhor;louvado seja Deus, nosso salvador!A cada dia ele
